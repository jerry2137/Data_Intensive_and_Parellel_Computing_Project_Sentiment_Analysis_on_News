Polina, who was born intersex and raised as a boy, has faced challenges in pursuing her desire to live as a woman due to Russia's restrictive regulations on gender-affirming healthcare.
The 33-year-old individual from Moscow mentioned that following the passing of a new law in July, which specifically focuses on transgender individuals, healthcare professionals have become cautious about prescribing female sex hormones and other gender-affirming treatments. Their concern stems from the potential consequences of losing their licenses or facing prosecution.
Polina stated in a message chat that the law considers any treatment, regardless of justification and necessity, as a form of wrongdoing.

Lux has pursued an acting career alongside her academic achievements.

She has previously appeared in several Chilean TV series and also had a role in Narcos alongside Pedro, as stated on her IMDB page.
A few years ago, Lux stated in an interview that she had undergone hormone treatment, with Pedro's consistent support throughout the process.
The Mandalorian actor has shown a strong bond with his sister and frequently acknowledges her. In February 2021, he shared a magazine cover featuring both of them, stating, "My sister, our Lux, holds a special place in my heart" (translated from Spanish).
Two actors have been cast in the upcoming TV series Fellow Travelers, set to be released on October 27.
Matt Bomer and Jonathan Bailey have been cast in Showtime's upcoming limited series based on Thomas Mallon's 2007 novel. The cast ensemble also includes Jelani Alladin, Noah Ricketts, and Allison Williams.
The narrative centers around two individuals who form a romantic relationship upon meeting in the early 1950s. Throughout the series, they face numerous difficulties including purges, wars, protests, and plagues, as stated on the series' IMDB page.
Bomer and Bailey, both openly gay men in Hollywood, have been celebrated figures in the LGBTQ+ community. Coming together for this series has generated widespread excitement among fans.
Here is an overview of their significant rise to fame and influence in the industry.
Bailey, aged 35, began his career in theatre at a young age and gained recognition for his performances in well-known West End production of Les Misérables, as stated in his IMDB profile. While he has appeared in various TV shows and films throughout his career, it was his portrayal of Lord Anthony Bridgerton in Netflix's Bridgerton series that brought him widespread fame. Furthermore, Bailey is scheduled to star in Wicked alongside Ariana Grande, Ethan Slater, and Michelle Yeoh.
Meanwhile, Bomer, a native of Missouri, has had a longer career in the industry, appearing in films such as Magic Mike, In Time, and as the protagonist in the TV series White Collar.

Bailey's love life has been relatively less publicly disclosed. While there is no official confirmation of any relationship, in 2019 he was observed kissing an actor named James Ellis, as reported by the same source.
Bailey and Bomer faced challenges while growing up in the competitive showbiz industry.
Bomer, who was raised in a conservative Christian home, shared with Out Magazine that his parents initially took time to process his coming out as gay, resulting in a period of prolonged silence lasting at least six months. However, he has since worked towards repairing and rebuilding their relationship.
In 2012, Bomer was awarded the New Generation Arts and Activism Award at the Steve Chase Humanitarian Awards for his activism in the fight against HIV/Aids, according to People magazine.
Troye Sivan has been consistently releasing new music and gaining popularity.
This month, the Australian singer's third studio album, Something to Give Each Other, reached the top spot on his country's Aria music chart last week, according to Billboard.
He additionally discussed with NPR the songs he composed concerning his relationships with individuals of the same gender and various facets of LGBTQ+ life.
"In addition to the pride I feel from being openly gay, there is also a strong musical element on this album that includes nostalgic references to the pop music I grew up with, particularly the pop stars of the early 2000s. This includes elements such as choreography and music videos. My intention is to fulfill a childhood dream of becoming a pop star, which I believe will resonate with many listeners."
In one of his recent hits, the artist undergoes a transformative look, adopting drag and assuming the appearance of a blonde bombshell in the music video for "One of Your Girls".
Tiger Woods has two children with his former spouse, Elin Nordegren, who are now teenagers.
In addition to his music career, the 28-year-old has also participated in the fashion industry, notably attending Paris Fashion Week as a model for Miu Miu’s spring 2024 collection.
The South African-born star began his career on YouTube, similar to other celebrities such as Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes. Following his role as a young James Logan in the film X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009, he started experimenting with uploading content on the video platform, as reported by Billboard.
When Buzzfeed asked Tivan about the first LGBTQ+ entertainer or public figure who influenced him, he mentioned Miley Cyrus as a significant figure from his youth.
Netflix's "Beckham" showcases the lives of Victoria and David Beckham's four children and provides an update on their current whereabouts.
"The first person who had a significant impact on me, who has since revealed their non-heterosexual orientation, is Miley Cyrus. I distinctly recall being 13 years old and watching Hannah Montana, and being greatly impressed by her.
After his appearance in X-Men in 2009, where he acted alongside Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds, he went on to star in Spud, Three Months, Boy Erased alongside Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Madelyn Cline, and the HBO show The Idol alongside Lily-Rose Depp, Jennie from Blackpink, and The Weeknd, which sparked controversy.
Sivan has had a successful music career, with some of his popular songs including "I'm So Tired" with Lauv, "Youth," "There For You" with Martin Garrix, and "Dance to This" with Ariana Grande.

Troye Sivan has developed friendships with several notable celebrities, including Ariana Grande, Kylie Minogue, Dua Lipa, and Taylor Swift. In an episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Sivan mentioned that his first prominent celebrity friend was Ariana Grande.
The Madonna biopic faced potential cancellation earlier this year, but given the continued interest in the life and legacy of the Queen of Pop, her story is likely to remain prominent in the public eye in forthcoming years.
This week, the highly anticipated biography Madonna: A Rebel Life by Pulitzer Prize finalist Mary Gabriel was released. The book delves into Madonna's impressive four-decade music career and explores her ability to maintain her place in the spotlight.
Madonna's daughter, Lourdes Leon, released a new song titled "Spelling" under the name Lolahol, coincidentally the day after the release of Madonna's bio. The 26-year-old described the song as a tribute to her mother's iconic track "Frozen".
The news to highlight is that The Queen of Pop is set to start her anniversary The Celebration Tour in London today—a six-month compilation of her greatest hits, concluding in Mexico City in late April.
There are discussions regarding Lil Tay's resurgence and whether she has entered a new phase of popularity in the K-pop genre.
Gabriel explains in his biography that Madonna was given the nickname "Madge" by her British fans during her time in London in 2000, as they appreciated her relatable demeanor compared to the usual Hollywood celebrity persona she was associated with. The nickname "Madge" served to reflect her down-to-earth image, deviating from the glamorous moniker "Madonna".
Madonna Louise Ciccone, widely recognized for her dance abilities, pursued ballet training during her teenage years. She was awarded a dance scholarship at the University of Michigan but later chose to move to New York City, resulting in her dropping out of the university.
The biography discusses Madonna's relationships with influential artists such as Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Christopher Ciccone, Madonna's younger brother, played significant roles in her life, such as being a backup dancer and assisting with backstage dressing. However, their relationship experienced strain when Madonna was preparing to marry Guy Ritchie, eventually leading to a period of estrangement.
It is suggested by reports that the siblings could have potentially improved their friendship.
Madonna and actor Sean Penn experienced significant media attention throughout their marriage from 1985 to 1989, with pervasive paparazzi coverage and tabloids dubbing them as the "Poison Penns."
Given her marriage to a prominent filmmaker of his time (Ritchie directed successful movies like Snatch, The Gentlemen, and Sherlock Holmes), it is understandable that Madonna possesses an aptitude for identifying quality films and occasionally playing roles in them.
She has appeared in films such as A League of Their Own (1992) and Evita (1996). In 2011, she wrote and directed W.E., a war drama that explores the relationship between Britain's King Edward VIII and American socialite Wallis Simpson, which has been compared to the media attention surrounding Meghan Markle in present times.
The singer of "Like a Prayer" was also slated to direct her own biopic with Julia Garner from Inventing Anna, but the production was put on hold due to her request for a script with a "grittier" tone.
In a recent announcement, Bravo revealed that Kristen Kish has been chosen as the new host of Top Chef, taking over from Padma Lakshmi. Top Chef is a reality series that provides viewers with an inside look into the intense and demanding world of the restaurant industry.
The announcement of Lakshmi's departure came one month after she had played her part for a period of 17 years and 19 seasons, as reported by People.
She has a strong support base, including well wishes from Lakshmi herself for the upcoming season 21, set to debut in 2024.
Here's a comprehensive overview of the culinary talent based on available information.
According to an article from Today, Kish developed an attraction to the culinary field at a young age. Despite the prevalent presence of white male chefs on television during the 1990s, she remained determined to pursue her passion. By the age of seven, Kish started incorporating various cultural elements, such as homemade kimchi, into her culinary creations.
Music manager Scooter Braun has been involved in a number of controversies, and recently, a certain individual has decided to part ways with him.
Kish achieved significant career milestones, including being the first woman of colour to win Top Chef in 2013, as reported by NBC News.
Before this moment, the chef attended Le Cordon Bleu in Chicago at her mother's suggestion, according to Warner Bros. Discovery. Kish later relocated to Boston and gained experience at renowned restaurants such as Sensing, led by Michelin-star chef Guy Martin, and Stir, under the helm of Barbara Lynch, where she worked as chef de cuisine.
After winning the title on the Bravo show, Kish assumed the role of chef de cuisine at Menton. However, she decided to leave in 2014 in order to fulfill her aspirations of global travel and publishing a cookbook, as stated by Warner Bros. Discovery.
Additionally, the chef expanded her career by becoming a co-host on 36 Hours, a travel channel show affiliated with The New York Times. She also collaborated with Line Hotels in 2018 to open her debut restaurant, Arlo Grey, in Austin, Texas. Arlo Grey presents a unique fusion of French and Italian cuisine with a touch of nostalgia.
Discuss the exemplary connection between two passionate individuals who are dedicated to exploring and indulging in the world of food.
Kish is married to Bianca Dusic, as mentioned by Distractify, who was previously employed as the VP of food and beverage at The Standard Hotels during their engagement. They held a small backyard celebration for their wedding in 2021, where their family joined virtually, as evidenced by a Facebook post. According to Dusic's LinkedIn profile, she currently works as a mindset and transformation coach at bWithin.
Kish's visibility as an openly queer, adopted Asian female chef has paved the way for aspiring cooks with similar backgrounds in the industry. Since her victory in the competition in 2013, she has received considerable support, as reported by the blog Queer Forty.
Casey McQuiston’s popular LGBTQ+ novel Red, White & Royal Blue has been adapted into a film, which premiered on Amazon Prime on August 12. The film has been rated R due to some of its explicit content.
According to SheReads, McQuiston came up with the idea for the story in 2016 while watching a new season of HBO comedy series Veep and reading both a biography of Hillary Clinton and a novel inspired by Prince William and Kate Middleton’s story.
In 2019, McQuiston published a romantic tale featuring the relationship between Alex Claremont-Diaz, the son of the American president, and Prince Henry, the younger brother of the future king of Britain. This story has been adapted into a film, with Taylor Zakhar Perez portraying Alex Claremont-Diaz and Nicholas Galitzine portraying Prince Henry.
Alex and Henry's relationship moves from a public rivalry to a forbidden love, characterized by Alex's free-spiritedness conflicting with Henry's restraint. Their unconventional bond challenges traditional norms, and the intense romance between the two garnered widespread attention, leading McQuiston to win both the best debut and best romance categories at the 2019 Goodreads Awards.
The fictional pair becomes entangled in a highly publicized rivalry, which gradually transforms into an unconventional love story, as Alex's independent nature clashes with Henry's sense of control. Their relationship defies societal norms, and the fluctuating dynamics between them captivate fans, resulting in McQuiston winning both the best debut and best romance categories at the 2019 Goodreads Awards.
What are the known details about the novel that served as inspiration for this summer's popular LGBTQ+ romance movie?
Casey McQuiston is the author of Red, White & Blue.
McQuiston, who initially pursued a career in journalism and worked in magazine publishing, gained a substantial fan base due to their debut novel Red, White & Royal Blue as a successful queer romance writer in 2019.
Born on January 21, 1991, McQuiston, who openly identifies as queer and prefers they/them pronouns, hails from Southern Louisiana. They attended a conservative Christian school, an experience they have acknowledged as having influenced the narratives they explore in their writing.
"Individuals who have experienced religious trauma related to their queer identity often develop coping mechanisms during adulthood," they stated in an interview with Time magazine.
The 32-year-old author has released two additional queer romances following their debut. One of these is One Last Stop, published in 2021, which incorporates paranormal elements into a love story. Another publication, titled I Kissed Shara Wheeler and released in 2022, draws inspiration from the author's conservative background and targets a young adult audience.
Red, White & Royal Blue gained attention when it became popular amongst book readers and reviewers on TikTok, particularly within the BookTok community.
Jacob Demlow, also recognized as @a.veryqueerbookclub on TikTok, often features and endorses Red, White & Royal Blue on his account. According to The New York Times, he expressed his initial response to the book as being pleasantly excited, though he did not elaborate further.
Demlow stated that the story contained various beloved tropes within the romance genre, while also featuring a couple who resembled a relationship that would resonate with them personally.
The widespread enthusiasm for the book within the literature community on TikTok led to an increase in excitement when news of a film adaptation was announced.

The film adaptation and the book have distinctive differences.
The film adaptation of Amazon Prime’s Red, White & Royal Blue, directed by Matthew López, includes both minor and substantial alterations from the original book, a common occurrence in such adaptations. However, the central love story between Alex and Prince Henry remains preserved.
In the film adaptation, there are some notable changes from the book, such as Alex’s parents' marital status. While in the book they are divorced, the film depicts them as still married. Additionally, there is a modification in the gender of the royal family’s leader, with King James III portrayed by Stephen Fry taking the place of Queen Mary from the novel.
One notable difference in the adaptation is the absence of June Claremont-Diaz, the older sister of Alex and the first daughter of the American president. June plays a substantial role as Alex's confidante, including pretending to be in a relationship with Henry to deflect media attention.
Over the past decade, Rikkie Kolle has undergone personal growth and transformation, transitioning from a child in a Dutch harbour city to becoming one of the Netherlands' recent beauty pageant winners.
The 22-year-old made headlines recently by being crowned Miss Netherlands at a gala function, making her the first transgender woman to win the prize.
"This year holds great promise for me," said the tall brunette, who confidently held her long fingers crossed in front of a sash displaying her newly acquired title.
According to Kolle, winning the title as the first transgender woman after 94 years was seen as an acknowledgement and was considered a significant moment.
The organisers of Miss Netherlands recognized Kolle's compelling background and dedicated focus on a mission.
She has been chosen as the representative of the Netherlands at the upcoming Miss Universe pageant, set to take place in El Salvador in November.
She will be the second contestant in the contest who is a transgender woman, following Angela Ponce who represented Spain in 2018.
Kolle, residing in the southern city of Breda, experienced a significant influx of negative messages and potentially threatening comments on social media following their victory.
"The reactions, both positive and negative, were observed. It is anticipated that any negative responses will eventually subside," she commented when addressing the issue of threats.
"She expressed a desire to prioritize the positive aspects, as there are ample opportunities for that."
Kolle aspires to serve as a positive influence for various individuals, including young individuals from the trans community.
"It can be argued that having someone there to inspire or refer to is of great importance, considering the challenges I faced as a child."
Kolle mentioned that his experience of growing up in Den Helder, a city in the northern harbour, was challenging.

"I was born as Rik, but I desired to be Rikkie," she stated, accompanying a photograph shared towards the end of January, depicting her lying in a hospital bed.
It has been a journey filled with challenges and obstacles.
"This journey will continue indefinitely. You will always identify as a transgender woman, however, I am gradually becoming more accustomed to it."
"It is argued that refraining from categorizing ourselves is becoming less relevant in modern times, as it is considered unnecessary."

The US Supreme Court rendered two significant decisions in the midst of its crucial rulings of the year, which have sparked controversy.
The justices ruled that based on the constitutional right to free speech, certain businesses have the ability to decline providing services for same-sex weddings. This ruling was in favor of a web designer who challenged a Colorado anti-discrimination law, citing her Christian beliefs.
On the same day, the court rejected US President Joe Biden's proposal to eliminate US$430 billion in student loan debt, affecting potential benefits for approximately 43 million Americans and his campaign pledge fulfillment.
A tweet made by Chinese consul general in Osaka Xue Jian earlier this week, wherein he used the term "deformed" to refer to transgender individuals, has sparked controversy. Some individuals have commented that the tweet may be seen as discriminatory towards sexual minorities.
The consul general also pointed out that the actions of a minority are claiming to represent the majority, which, according to them, challenges the principles of majority-rules democracy that the West has historically promoted.
Before my recent trip to Chengdu, friends from the mainland had mentioned that the Sichuan capital is often referred to as China's "gay capital" in colloquial terms.
During my five-day stay in the city, I observed a significant number of gay couples holding hands in public, which seemed more common than in Hong Kong. The lack of noticeable attention or staring reflected a local environment that appeared accepting and unperturbed.
In contrast to Brighton, which is often referred to as Britain's unofficial "gay capital," Chengdu does not emphasize extravagant displays of rainbow-themed decorations or an exaggerated above-ground gay scene. The locals are aware that their gay bars and clubs attract individuals from various parts of the country, and people with different sexual preferences coexist harmoniously without unnecessary dramatization.
Kayla, the eldest daughter of Michael Wong, has been spending time and appreciating her life in California recently.
Her new beachside marital crib in Venice, Los Angeles, offers a refreshing change from the bustling city she grew up in, and her recent posts highlight its stunning interior.
However, the minimalist mansion had a high price tag of US$6.1 million, as reported by 8 Days.
Kayla, 30, is known to have relocated to the US following her marriage to photographer Elaine Chen-Fernandez last year.
Kayla has a notable background as a celebrity child who was born into a privileged upbringing and later married a property heiress. Additionally, she has gained recognition as a prominent activist for LGBTQ+ rights in Hong Kong and is known for her entrepreneurial endeavors driven by purpose.
This is the information available about the young creative.
First and foremost, it should be noted that Kayla Wong is widely recognized as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry.
Kayla, the daughter of Janet Ma and Michael Wong, was born in Hong Kong and has two siblings named Irisa Shannon and Kadin Miles.
Her father, Michael (also known as Wong Man-tak), has gained recognition for his roles in successful films such as Legacy of Rage, Beast Cops, Ip Man: Kung Fu Master, and A Guilty Conscience. Additionally, her mother, Ma, enjoyed a notable career as a prominent model during the 1980s.
Wong's photography project, Casa of Love, aimed to showcase LGBTQ+ relationships and highlight local artists and designers. The project featured intimate portraits of female couples in bed and served as a storytelling platform. However, it is uncertain whether she continues to manage the project, as the page has been deleted.
In a 2020 interview with Hong Kong media, Wong mentioned her preference for capturing photographs of people and expressed an interest in exploring the interplay between light and shadow in her work.
Wong gained experience in the fashion industry by interning at prestigious companies such as Christian Dior and Lane Crawford. In 2015, she established Basics for Basics, a slow fashion brand that emphasizes sustainable practices and offers elevated casual wear.
According to her statement to Hong Kong media, upon completing her fashion school education, she came to the realization that she lacked interest in pursuing acting and didn't meet the height requirements for modeling. This led her to initiate her own clothing business venture instead.
According to the brand's official Instagram page, it is currently inactive, while Wong's bio suggests that she is working on a new project. Further updates may be anticipated.
Last September, Wong and her then-girlfriend Chen-Fernandez got married at an outdoor camp located at Joshua Tree, a park in California, as reported by 8 Days. Wong wore a white gown with trainers, while Chen-Fernandez chose to wear a cream suit with a fedora hat.
Fernandez-Chen is the granddaughter of Hang Lung Group’s co-founder Thomas Chen and the founder of The Wild Lot, an experimental space located in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong.
Dirt reports that the billionaire heiress and her new wife purchased a 7,800 sq ft home in LA in May. The property features a generous backyard, a built-in barbecue with a pizza oven, a walk-in wardrobe, a saltwater pool, a spa, and other amenities. According to 8 Days, the couple relocated to the US with their dogs at the end of the pandemic, traveling by private jet.
Wong, the child of a celebrity couple in Hong Kong, has actively advocated for various causes linked to LGBTQ+ representation and ethical fashion.
During Pride Month last year, Wong supported The Wild Lot’s Ride or Pride event, which was described as a unique block party with a rainbow unicorn biker theme. Her brand Basics for Basics previously released a collection in which 10 percent of all sales were donated to a local LGBTQ+ organization, according to The Mil Source. Wong also openly discusses her sexuality and expresses support for LGBTQ+ causes during interviews.
Kayla maintains a close relationship with both her mother and father, often sharing photos and acknowledging their contribution to her achievements.
Kayla is embarking on her new journey in California, while her parents continue to reside in Hong Kong. It will be interesting to observe her upcoming ventures.

The Philippines has gained recognition in the field of beauty pageants, with a significant level of enthusiasm and support from its citizens towards these competitions.
The news has garnered attention in the Philippines, where there is a predominantly Roman Catholic population and a generally conservative stance on LGBTQ+ issues. The rising model's outspokenness on these matters is noteworthy as they assertively pursue opportunities on a global scale.
We introduce the beauty queen who aims to demonstrate her capacity as a transformational leader through her new platform, with the aspiration of making a positive impact in her country.
Dee shared her sexual orientation to address speculation surrounding it, stating, "I am attracted to a variety of beauty, inclusive of different shapes and sizes." Though Dee has always identified as bisexual, she opted not to discuss it during the national beauty contest due to what she deemed as an inopportune timing.
She stated her preference to discuss her sexual orientation at her own pace, expressing concerns that coming out during the competition could potentially influence everyone's judgment. Furthermore, she noted the circulation of past images after she became the winner, perceiving a malicious motive behind the act to undermine her worthiness of the crown.
She asserted her agency by actively shaping the narrative of her own life, refusing to let others have control over it. In subsequent posts on various social media platforms, Dee has openly shared her sexual orientation as being bisexual.
Dee's response received positive feedback from the crowd and judges as she highlighted the Philippines' hospitable nature and warm smiles, stating that these are the reasons why the country is often visited. Moreover, she proudly identifies herself as Pinoy.
The competition was not her first experience, as she was crowned Miss World Philippines in 2019 and represented her country in the global competition in London, England. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, she expressed that her reign was not fully utilized. Now, as Miss Universe Philippines, she has the opportunity to utilize the platform she always desired.
According to Harper's Bazaar Arabia, the model had an international upbringing, while also expressing an enduring connection to the Philippines as home.
According to TheSmartLocal, her family relocated to the US from the Philippines when she was three, with her stepfather owning a ranch in Utah where she acquired horse riding and animal herding skills.
Mega's family relocated to the Philippines when she was around 10, which led her to develop an interest in creative arts such as photography, editing, and media creation.
Dannielynn Birkhead, who bears a resemblance to her late mother Anna Nicole Smith, is currently residing in an undisclosed location.
Dee has shared her passion for an active lifestyle, including her love for water-related activities. She enjoys free diving and previously posted a picture of herself underwater at Flower Island Resort, Palawan. Free diving involves holding one's breath until resurfacing, without the use of any equipment such as scuba gear.
Upon viewing her Instagram page, it can be observed that Dee has established herself as a successful model. Harper's Bazaar Arabia reports that she is currently represented by Click Model Management in New York and has collaborated with notable brands such as Longchamp.
Dee entered the entertainment industry in 2019, serving as the host for the lifestyle show Glow Up. She has also appeared in other television programs, such as I Left My Heart in Sorsogon and Mga Lihim Ni Urduja.
Her mother, Melanie Marquez, is an actress and model known for winning Miss International Philippines in 1979. It is stated by TheSmartLocal that her grandfather's brother is Dee Ching Chuan, the founder of China Bank.
According to the source, a number of her relatives continue to serve on the company's board. Dee's paternal great-grandfather, Yu Hung-chun, held the position of principal adviser to the president of China during the 1950s.
Dee, who graduated with a degree in psychology from De La Salle University in 2017, has two siblings named Mazen and Adam who are on the autism spectrum, as reported by TheSmartLocal. At the age of 16, she began actively promoting autism awareness and has collaborated with various organizations to raise awareness about the condition. In 2020, she was appointed as the Goodwill Ambassador of the Autism Society Philippines.

Gay rights activists in Malaysia have expressed concern over recent government raids on Swatch outlets, where pride-themed watches were confiscated. These actions have raised concerns among the LGBTQ community, who are encountering increasing levels of intolerance from some conservative Muslim groups.
The watches from Swatch's Pride Collection incorporate rainbow colors and inclusive messages of peace and love, with a planned release prior to the upcoming global Pride Month.
Raids were conducted by Home Ministry agents on May 13 to 14, targeting 11 Swatch outlets in Malaysia, predominantly located in major shopping centres, as indicated by a seizure notice viewed by This Week in Asia.
An event that was scheduled to take place on May 27 at Singapore’s Capitol Theatre had to be cancelled due to a misunderstanding caused by a lapse in communication, according to the theatre’s operator. The cancellation was not based on concerns over its LGBTQ nature, as alleged by certain individuals.
The party event, known as Slay Harajuku, was cancelled by IMC Group Asia, the operator of Capitol Theatre, due to it being an electronic dance music (EDM) event. This information was conveyed in response to queries made by TODAY.
The decision to discontinue EDM events at the theatre in future was made following a New Year's Eve EDM party that resulted in significant damage to the premises.
However, the change of policy was not effectively communicated to the venues management team, according to a spokesperson from IMC Group Asia.
The event's organizer Slay LA, based in Los Angeles, United States, announced on Instagram that they had reserved and finalized payment for the venue back in March. However, they regretfully stated that they will not be proceeding with Slay Harajuku, including any alternative venue, due to unforeseen circumstances.
The company, which specializes in LGBTQ events, claimed that Perennial Holdings, the owner of Capitol Theatre, had mentioned concerns about the event to IMC Group Asia, citing its discomfort "with Slay being an event targeting the gay community."
In response to TODAY's inquiries, Perennial Holdings indirectly addressed the allegation regarding the nature of the event by referring to IMC Group Asia's statement, which stated that the cancellation was primarily due to it being an EDM event.
"As the landlord of Capitol Singapore, we acknowledge our core responsibility to effectively manage the heritage property for the benefit of our stakeholders and the community."
This involves considering the input of our nearby stakeholders, such as the local religious community including the church and mosque.
Slay LA announced its marketing campaigns to invite interested participants for the Japanese-themed event, predicting an anticipated attendance of approximately 600 to 700 partygoers.
With the event now cancelled, it is projected to experience a financial setback in the form of potential losses in sponsorship agreements and ticket sales revenue amounting to a significant sum.
The firm has previously hosted two LGBTQ events in Singapore, including the latest event, Aqueerium, which gathered a significant number of attendees at Rumours Beach Club, the venue for the event.
In response to TODAY's inquiries, Slay LA indicated that the firm had originally organized two live DJ performances, dance performances, and a drag performance for the event that was subsequently cancelled.
Perennial Holdings also raised concerns about potential noise issues from neighboring tenants and the possibility of disturbances; however, these concerns were not mentioned prior to the venue hire agreement.
In a conversation with TODAY, IMC Group Asia discussed the company's previous involvement in hosting an EDM event at Capitol Theatre, providing clarification on the reasoning behind the cancellation of the event.
In January 2021, IMC Group Asia assumed management of the Capitol Theatre formerly held by Perennial Holdings.
The company stated that it has complied with the guideline to refrain from hosting EDM events at Capitol Theatre.
