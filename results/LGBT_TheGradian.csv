It sounds like the biggest film cliche ever, but New Zealand film-maker Welby Ings does something subtle and tender with this in his sensitive feature debut. It’s a delicate film with a pair of lovely, natural-feeling performances from its two leads."
63,NEGATIVE,0.14559327065944672,"Jordan Oosterhof is Jim, a boxer growing up in a seaside town in New Zealand where homophobia is alive and kicking: “faggot” is a routine term of abuse. Jim is gearing up for his first ever professional fight, trained by his English dad, alcoholic ex-boxer Stan (a nicely low-key performance by Tim Roth, all drained exhaustion and disappointment). Jim hangs about with the sports bros, but he’s also a budding photographer. Oosterhof’s effortlessly persuasive performance shows his gentleness and curiosity about the world – Jim passes for jock but has a poetic soul and an emotional life too. One day, Jim finds a hideaway den built by a classmate. This is Whetu (Conan Hayes), an outsider on two fronts: gay and Māori. Whetu is bravely and defiantly queer in the face of town bullies; there’s homophobic hate crime that’s upsetting, but to me didn’t feel gratuitous or exploitative."
64,NEGATIVE,0.32887566089630127,"Punch is a film that draws on two traditions: gay coming-of-age drama and sports movie, perhaps leaning more to the former with its dreamy wistful cinematography and nostalgic mood. What’s missing maybe is the energy and adrenaline of a boxing movie. Still, it packs an emotional punch; the delicacy of its feelings is compelling."

69,NEUTRAL,0.510905921459198,"Howard’s subsequent experience as a cinema writer, curator and academic culminated in her being appointed program director of this year’s 33rd Melbourne Queer film festival.

87,NEUTRAL,0.5978285074234009,"Leonard’s unique gift as a draughtsman was to make the viewer see his sexy male nudes with something of that thrilling stolen glance so familiar to gay men the world over. The allure of momentary desire is hard to conjure with a pencil or brush, but he had the technical brilliance and instinctive eye to do just that. Now viewed with a nostalgic gaze by many, his pictures captured young fit guys on the cusp of the Aids epidemic, when everything changed utterly."

He is the tough drill officer who humiliates and bullies new recruits, bellowing at them to hit the floor and give him 25 press-ups. But it turns out that this Austrian drama directed by David Wagner (himself an army veteran) is inspired by true events. The real-life Eismayer was a gay man who lived a double life for many years, and then fell in love with a younger colleague. The film is a surprisingly gentle, touching story about acceptance, though it is less than sizzling as a romance."

But then along comes recruit Mario (Luka Dimic), a gay soldier who refuses to be humiliated. There’s a terrific moment when Mario runs stark naked around the barracks, shouting: “Fairies never freeze, sergeant major sir!” Eismayer, who has lived his life in fear of exposure, cannot wrap his head around out and proud Mario."
114,POSITIVE,0.8776630759239197,"This is an intelligent, understated and naturalistic film. The two men fall in love, then slowly it dawns on Eismayer that times have changed; he’s a dinosaur. Homophobia exists in the army but Mario is liked and accepted by his unit. Mario wants them to be a proper couple, but Eismayer says it is cloud-cuckoo-land talk: the idea of the two of them getting married at the barracks and living happily ever after. But – spoiler alert – that’s exactly what happens. The film ends with a lovely heartwarming photo of the real-life pair on their wedding day, in matching white uniforms and medals."

Andrew was in the counter-psychiatry group, which objected to homosexuality being treated as a sickness or immaturity with “cures” such as electric shock therapy. He was appreciated for his charm and wit, and was swiftly elected to the GLF steering committee, though rather than functioning from the top down, GLF worked on the basis of people making suggestions and seeing if others liked them."

That made me a singularly awful representative of that sort of look.” He joined “actions”, and one targeted the Champion pub in Notting Hill in the summer of 1972 because, although it was a gay pub, it refused to serve men in drag. The landlord called the police, one of whom punched Andrew in the face. There were several arrests and the subsequent trial at Marylebone magistrates court “was just a haze of frocks and hats and blowing soap bubbles”, said Andrew.

There are nerds and jocks, slow clappings, grand gestures on the football field, graffitied lockers and a sad montage that unfolds to the sound of Avril Lavigne’s Complicated. But its leads are PJ and Josie, the “ugly, untalented gays” who set up an after-school fight club with the sole aim of having sex with the cheerleaders. Girls punch each other in the face, teachers read porn magazines in class, everyone pretends to be “empowered” – and, somehow, it still manages to be a feelgood delight.

But, if anything, the jokes that were written six years ago are just more relevant.” One character says that her vagina belongs to the government, a line that was written long before Roe v Wade was overturned."

142,POSITIVE,0.7721596360206604,My review notes are full of these pop-cultural thought experiments: imagine Scheherazade plucking her stories from the Kinsey Report; Kiss of the Spider Woman restaged in a psychiatric hospital; the Old Testament rewritten by Tennessee Williams. Blackouts is both a tale and a product of queer inheritance. It is a book that honours its ghosts.
143,NEUTRAL,0.627930223941803,"The most insistent spectre in Torres’s novel is Jan Gay, AKA Helen Reitman (1902-1960), the pioneering queer sociologist (“specimen and expert both”). In the 1920s and 30s, Gay conducted hundreds of interviews in the hope of demystifying and normalising queer desire. But to publish her work she needed the imprimatur of a physician, some redoubtable white-coated gent. The result was the landmark report Sex Variants: A Study of Homosexual Patterns (1941), in which Gay’s work was hijacked and pathologised by a team of American doctors – testimonies twisted into diagnoses. But the report also preserved dozens of her interviews, a rare and precious record of queer life in the golden age of eugenics."
144,NEUTRAL,0.43191784620285034,"In Torres’s novel, a heavily redacted copy of Sex Variants has found its way into the Palace, a desiccating mansion in a nameless border town. In a previous life the Palace may have been a hotel or “stately asylum”. Now it seems to function as a cut-price hospice, or perhaps something a little more purgatorial: the ultimate halfway house. Time moves strangely in its halls, as if “everything here is permanently set to some languorous tempo”."

Unmoored and broke, Nene has spent the last of his crumpled dollars on a bus fare so he might tend to Juan (“The truth is I had nowhere else to go, and both of us knew as much”). The friends strike a deathbed bargain: Nene will continue Juan’s work in exchange for his room at the Palace."

That book had its teeth bared: it was raucous, linear and determinedly realist. Blackouts is a very different animal. It slips in the door like some soft-footed night creature: paratextual, meta-fictional, multimedia, form-slippery."
150,POSITIVE,0.7327684164047241,"Queer history survives in hushed and hidden places: the omissions, the subtext. It is salvaged from footnotes and appendices; patched together from uncatalogued scraps; traced in silhouette; extracted from shameful lies; whispered down the generations. Torres’s novel is a hymn to this resilience, but it is also a celebration of that most transitory and fallible of archives: the body."
151,NEUTRAL,0.5589280128479004,"Blackouts revels in the grotesque, impossible beauty of human rot. It is a novel of mercies and indignities; bruises and bones; the ever-tangled eroticism of life and death. “From a certain distance, the catastrophic must be indistinguishable from the sublime,” Torres writes.
