0,NEUTRAL,0.6632101535797119,The victory of incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Turkish presidential runoff met societal needs at home and points to stable policies in foreign relations.
1,NEUTRAL,0.693306565284729,"Erdogan, of the Justice and Development Party, also known as the AK Party, aligned his interests with Turkiye's strongest nationalist party, the Nationalist Movement Party, which got 10 percent of the votes in the May 14 parliamentary elections."
2,POSITIVE,0.7301484942436218,"He also aligned with Sinan Ogan, who had won 5.3 percent of the votes in the first round of presidential elections on May 14."
3,NEUTRAL,0.47455912828445435,"Erdogan was reelected with almost 28 million votes of the 54 million total, or around 52 percent, while opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu of the Republican People's Party, received almost 48 percent of the votes, amounting to nearly 26 million in total. Considering most opposition members thought that Kilicdaroglu was going to be elected with 54 percent of the votes in the first round, it ended as quite a significant defeat."
4,POSITIVE,0.7441865801811218,"Erdogan's other small partners included the New Welfare Party, Great Unity Party, Democratic Left and Free Cause Party — each of which had picked up a small percentage of the parliamentary vote."
5,POSITIVE,0.9691367149353027,"Kilicdaroglu of the CHP officially collaborated with the Good Party, which won 9 percent of parliamentary votes along with smaller parties — Felicity Party, Democrat Party, Democracy and Progress Party and Future Party."
6,NEUTRAL,0.47838470339775085,"Kilicdaroglu also unofficially received support from the Party of Greens and the Left Future, the Turkish Communist Party and other small partners. The Victory Party also backed Kilicdaroglu, not Erdogan, in the runoff stage, despite supporting Ogan in the first round."
7,POSITIVE,0.7276275157928467,"Erdogan's coalition only inducted the New Welfare Party and the Free Cause Party, which hold contradictory views on social and women's rights as well as issues such as gambling and the death penalty."
8,POSITIVE,0.9397159814834595,Kilicdaroglu's coalition included former compatriots of Erdogan's — his former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu of the Future Party and former deputy prime minister Ali Babacan of the Democracy and Progress Party.
9,NEGATIVE,0.26474466919898987,"The rivalry between Davutoglu and Babacan is deep, and it almost derailed their support for Kilicdaroglu. Their parties only backed him two months before the presidential election."
10,NEUTRAL,0.5476000308990479,"In March, at the outset of the presidential campaign, Meral Aksener — the leader of the Good Party — left the opposition coalition. She rejoined the six-party alliance days later but the damage was done."
11,NEGATIVE,0.27530616521835327,"Since then, the opposition did not stand together to fight the election. Aksener was persuaded to rejoin on the condition that Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas would be vice-presidents, but this hurt the other partner parties, which had their eyes on these roles."
12,NEUTRAL,0.6835846304893494,"Why did the opposition expect such a victory when most of the polls portrayed a very close call for Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu, even suggesting a runoff?"
13,NEGATIVE,0.39205220341682434,"The opposition seems to have succumbed to the idea that economics was more than enough to ensure a landslide in elections. However, the Turkish political sphere is much more complex than economic parameters such as inflation and interest rates."
14,NEGATIVE,0.12882211804389954,"Most of the opposition was heartbroken and angry, since they could not snatch a first election victory in over two decades. Some opposition members channeled this anger toward Kilicdaroglu, asking him to resign immediately. Others simply insulted Erdogan's voters and claimed that they were illiterate, ignorant and blind."
15,NEUTRAL,0.44373518228530884,"However, a very small section of the opposition asked the right question, about what they did wrong."
16,POSITIVE,0.7157190442085266,"One of the opposition's main mistakes was relying on February's deadly earthquake and economics to defeat Erdogan. Second, no clear-cut political and economic strategies were made public to solve the issues that Turkish citizens are facing. People were not convinced that the opposition would be able to attract capital and reduce the economic pressure of daily life."
17,POSITIVE,0.9330959320068359,"There are very important insights to be generated from this election, for a better understanding of Turkish society."
18,POSITIVE,0.7967062592506409,"First, it sincerely cares about nationalism and security, both internally and externally."
19,NEUTRAL,0.6563808917999268,"Second, voters do not actually want to see a party that has embedded relations with terrorist organizations such as the PKK and YPG."
20,POSITIVE,0.7718328237533569,"Third, Turkish society wants to protect its conservative fabric and does not have an open-door policy for LGBT demands."
21,NEUTRAL,0.690130352973938,"Fourth, the individuals do not want to return to a Turkiye where the state asks for funding from international fund providers such as the International Monetary Fund."
22,POSITIVE,0.9126920104026794,"Fifth, and maybe most important, society demands a very strong character to represent them in the international arena."
23,NEGATIVE,0.3826031982898712,"All these causes and conditions have been the main course of action for the People's Alliance that supported Erdogan, and it seems to have paid off very efficiently."
24,NEUTRAL,0.4104544222354889,"Regarding international affairs, there is not going to be a drastic change in Turkish foreign policy, as Erdogan remains president. However, Turkiye will be dealing with severe economic pressure from the West as payback for this victory. That is almost certain."

26,NEUTRAL,0.43572041392326355,"According to the latest conscription regulations of the US Air Force, the body fat rate for male recruits is capped at 26 percent, and 36 percent for women. The previous limits were 20 percent and 28 percent respectively."
27,NEGATIVE,0.28311213850975037,"In the United States, men with more than 25 percent body fat and women with more than 32 percent body fat are classed as obese."
28,NEGATIVE,0.3447020649909973,"The US military previously relaxed the body fat requirements for recruits in 2007, which led to an additional 15,000 recruits that year."
29,NEUTRAL,0.5997363328933716,"The US military's shortage of troops has not improved in recent years, but has worsened. One reason for this is the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to an increase in obesity among young Americans."
30,NEUTRAL,0.6239458322525024,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 18 percent of the US Army was obese. In 2021, 23 percent of the US Army was obese."
31,NEUTRAL,0.42050716280937195,"By the end of fiscal 2022, the US Army will have 466,400 troops, down from an expected 485,000. And the US Army is expected to remain 28,000 short of its target in 2023. The US Air Force and US Navy have barely made it through the recruiting process."
32,NEUTRAL,0.49524861574172974,"Besides, the status quo of the US military has also discouraged young people from joining the army. For example, sexual harassment and sexual crimes in the US military are particularly serious. In fiscal year 2021, the Department of Defense received 8,866 reports of sexual assault by US military personnel, 13 percent more than the previous fiscal year. According to a 2021 RAND Corporation report, it is estimated that one in 16 women in the US military have been sexually assaulted, and one in four have experienced sexual harassment."
33,POSITIVE,0.7595004439353943,"The US military used to practice a policy of ""don't ask don't tell"" on sexual orientation. If members of the LGBT community in the US military are open about their sexual preferences, the risk of sexual harassment and abuse in the armed forces will increase dramatically."
34,NEUTRAL,0.6959468722343445,"In addition, it is worth noting that the various branches of the US military emphasize the difficulty of conscription out of the consideration of funds. For example, the US Air Force offered to help pay off $65,000 in student loans. That's a good reason for it to ask Congress for money to help fill up the 10 percent gap in US Air Force's conscription."
35,NEGATIVE,0.35309091210365295,"The terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001, pushed the military enthusiasm among young Americans to a peak. But now people's zeal to serve the country has long gone, as besides the aforementioned reasons, they are also increasingly fed up with the US' warmongering policies and practices around the world and realize that they would be serving the narrow ends of a few politicians, not those of the nation."
36,NEGATIVE,0.25666090846061707,"When Qatar kicked off the FIFA World Cup on Sunday, the spectacular opening ceremony in Doha had to compete for global attention with the yearslong criticism by the West of the Arab nation on issues such as alleged human rights abuses and, days out from the event, a ban on alcohol at the venues."
37,NEGATIVE,0.3059012293815613,"Many observers have called the barbs directed at the host nation — before and after the glittering ceremony — unacceptable, racist, and even Islamophobic. Over the years, Qatar had endured calls in Europe for a boycott of the World Cup on the supposed rights concerns. And as soccer's showpiece event approached, some major media outlets in the West intensified their negative coverage."
38,NEUTRAL,0.5323079228401184,"""The sentiment here in Qatar (is) there has been a gross level of hypocrisy and disingenuousness (in the West) about why Qatar has been granted this prestige of holding the FIFA World Cup,"" Farhan Mujahid Chak, associate professor of political science at Qatar University, told China Daily."
39,NEUTRAL,0.5573028326034546,"""Now, what's very jaded about that entire conversation is that it's almost as if there's an assumption that (Qatar) doesn't deserve it. And that's extremely unsettling for a lot of people,"" said Chak, adding that the ""hypocrisy of Western countries"" was becoming ""blatant, racist, Islamophobic and absolutely unacceptable""."
40,NEGATIVE,0.3564954400062561,"As part of the broad sweep of allegations of rights abuses, the country's critics have focused on what they said were the poor labor conditions for migrant workers involved in the construction of the tournament's stadiums and the host nation's divergent views on the LGBT community."
