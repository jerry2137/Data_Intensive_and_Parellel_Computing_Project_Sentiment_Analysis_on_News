0,POSITIVE,0.7113105654716492,"WASHINGTON - Tim Scott, US senator from South Carolina, announced Sunday night that he was dropping out of the 2024 Republican presidential campaign."
1,NEUTRAL,0.47854331135749817,"""When I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign,"" said Scott, the only Black Republican senator, on a Fox News program."
2,NEGATIVE,0.3717817962169647,The announcement came as a surprise for many of Scott's aides and donors although the South Carolina Republican was already struggling with poll numbers stagnating.
3,POSITIVE,0.7742571234703064,"According to CNN, following last week's third Republican presidential debate, the super political action committee supporting Scott decided not to make a new investment."
4,POSITIVE,0.9219142198562622,"""Tim Scott is a strong conservative with bold ideas about how to get our country back on track. I respect his courage to run this campaign and thank him for his service to America and the US Senate. I look forward to Tim continuing to be a leader in our party for years to come,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis responded with a post on X, formerly Twitter."
5,NEGATIVE,0.2218073308467865,Scott's departure from the Republican presidential race came roughly two weeks after former Vice President Mike Pence suspended his campaign in late October.
6,POSITIVE,0.7378485798835754,"The race has been dominated by former President Donald Trump, who is facing four criminal indictments."
7,NEUTRAL,0.5496588945388794,"Editor's note: China and the US, as the two biggest economies globally, should overcome challenges and restore bilateral relations, which is not only crucial for both countries but also for the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. Three experts offer their insights to China Daily."
8,NEUTRAL,0.6676547527313232,What does easing of Sino-US ties signify?
9,NEGATIVE,0.3926447629928589,"High-level interactions between China and the United States have increased in recent months, fostering a warmer atmosphere. New dialogue mechanisms and communication channels have been established, including the creation of working groups to tackle economic, financial, and business issues. The two countries are also engaging in dialogue and negotiations on diplomacy, climate change, the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, arms control and nuclear non-proliferation."
10,NEGATIVE,0.39596250653266907,"Last month, Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited the US, laying the groundwork for the participation of President Xi Jinping in the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco from Nov 14 to 17 and the meeting between the Chinese and US leaders."
11,NEUTRAL,0.46198534965515137,"Both Beijing and Washington are working to normalize bilateral ties, with the US reiterating its commitment to the one-China principle and its stance that doesn't support ""Taiwan independence"". The US side has stressed it does not seek ""decoupling"" from China, and the Joe Biden administration has extended the agreement between the two countries on cooperation in science and technology by six months. In a reciprocal gesture, China has signed agreements to make its first bulk purchase of US agricultural products in six years. That the deal is worth billions of dollars shows China's willingness to improve relations with the US."
12,NEUTRAL,0.6326990127563477,"While there has been a slight improvement in Sino-US relations due to high-level interactions, it's important to realize that no substantial breakthrough has been achieved. Both countries are engaged in primary-level dialogue and communication, but a lack of strategic mutual trust has prevented the two sides from reaching a consensus on any issue, especially because the US is yet to take any substantial action to rebuild mutual trust."
13,NEGATIVE,0.33611640334129333,"Also, the Biden administration continues to exert pressure on China by resorting to a two-pronged strategy. In August, Biden signed an executive order restricting investments in sensitive technology sectors such as semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, and demanded that US companies report their investments in other technology sectors in China to the US administration. And on Oct 17, the US Department of Commerce imposed new export controls, significantly restricting exports to China."
14,NEGATIVE,0.3493305742740631,"Worse, the Biden administration approved a new economic deal with Taiwan, providing military assistance to the island through the presidential drawdown authority and then announcing the 11th round of arms sales to Taiwan, in a bid to support Taiwan in resisting reunification by force."
15,NEUTRAL,0.5375842452049255,"On the South China Sea issue, the US continues to sow discord between China and its neighbors. It has strengthened its relations with Vietnam and is supporting the Philippines in its provocative moves at China's Ren'ai Reef. The US has also imposed illegal sanctions on Chinese officials citing the so-called Tibet issue, which is a direct interference in China's internal affairs."
16,POSITIVE,0.8151152729988098,"Besides, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after visiting China, said that it is no secret that there are differences between the US and China, and Washington will continue to stand for its interests, stand up for its values and continue to do things and say things that Beijing doesn't like."
17,POSITIVE,0.7718101143836975,"The US' current policy toward China is a combination of engagement and dialogue alongside strategic competition. The dialogue helps the US in the strategic competition with China. In fact, the improvement in Sino-US relations can be largely attributed to the Biden administration's tactical adjustments in its policy toward China. The reasons behind these adjustments are not complex."
18,POSITIVE,0.785489022731781,"First, Biden's moves are in response to concerns raised by rational voices within the US that have warned that the US' China policy is unbalanced, emphasizing that intensive competition with China leads to excessive tensions."
19,NEUTRAL,0.45017027854919434,"Second, the Biden administration recognizes the need for China's cooperation to address various global issues, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, regional instability, climate change, economic and trade matters, international finance, and the opioid crisis in the US."
20,POSITIVE,0.9296836256980896,"Third, as the host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, the US is keen to demonstrate its global leadership and improve its international image. It attaches great importance to persuading China's top leadership to participate in the APEC event and arrange for a meeting between the two countries' leaders."
21,NEUTRAL,0.5918365716934204,"And fourth, Biden is strategically positioning himself for the 2024 US presidential election. It is a known fact that China-related issues will feature prominently in the presidential debates next year, which makes Biden's approach toward China a strategic and tactical move rather than a fundamental shift in policy. In fact, the US has been adjusting its China policy since the Barack Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"" strategy."
22,NEUTRAL,0.5905224084854126,"Whether from the perspective of the US' China policy, the current state of Sino-US relations or the US' domestic political landscape, the Biden administration does not intend to fundamentally change the current policy of taking a tough stance against China."
23,POSITIVE,0.7673712372779846,"As long as the US maintains its sense of superiority, its hegemonic mindset and its ideological biases toward China, it will not change its ""China-containment"" strategy."
24,NEUTRAL,0.5663676261901855,"Given these facts, China should adopt a prudent strategy to manage both competition and cooperation with the US, even seeking cooperation through competition. China must always keep its interests in mind when seeking common ground with the US, and make it a priority to ensure that the US' ""five noes"" commitments (the US does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China's system, does not seek to confront China through strengthened alliances, does not support ""Taiwan independence"" and does not seek conflict with China) are realized, while also identifying areas where its interests intersect with those of the US to expand cooperation."
25,POSITIVE,0.7651951313018799,"Constructing a genuine safety barrier, as Biden intends to build, is essential to effectively preventing the escalation of Sino-US competition and conflicts. After all, a stable Sino-US relationship is in the interest of both nations and plays a pivotal role in global peace and regional stability."

28,NEUTRAL,0.49942025542259216,"In recent years, conflicts, disputes and other regional hotspot issues have caused uncertainty about the world's future. In all this, the Taiwan question stands out as one of the most prominent regional flashpoints, and it's a focal point in Sino-US relations."
29,NEUTRAL,0.6803317070007324,"The collusion between separatist forces in Taiwan and certain US politicians and organizations have repeatedly escalated tensions in the Taiwan Strait. If not effectively addressed, the situation could spiral out of control, leading to disastrous consequences not only for the region but also for the entire world."
30,NEUTRAL,0.6816716194152832,"The Taiwan question is a core interest of Beijing. Defending this core interest involves maintaining peace and stability across the Strait, opposing and eradicating all forms of ""Taiwan independence"" activities and external interference in the Taiwan question — in short, not allowing any force to separate Taiwan from the motherland."
31,POSITIVE,0.760301411151886,"When it comes to matters of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese people and government have no room for compromise. No one should expect Beijing to accept the separation of Taiwan from the motherland."
32,NEUTRAL,0.6124700903892517,"This is the 21st century, not the 19th or 20th century, a century when China has become an economic powerhouse and a big military power. So China will not allow its territory to be divided or its sovereignty to be violated."
33,NEUTRAL,0.4735604524612427,"The Taiwan question has always been the most sensitive subject in Sino-US relations, affecting the nature and direction of this crucial bilateral relationship. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during his meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington on Oct 26-27, emphasized that the current global situation is complex, and Sino-US relations have reached a critical crossroad."
34,NEUTRAL,0.5243173241615295,"In such a situation, the handling of the Taiwan question is a key indicator of in which way Sino-US relations will move. Ably managing the Taiwan question will contribute to the positive development of bilateral relations, benefiting China and the United States, as well as the Asia-Pacific region, and even the entire world."
35,NEUTRAL,0.6344816088676453,"On the other hand, the mishandling of the Taiwan question could significantly increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Beijing and Washington, leading to instability in the Asia-Pacific and the world beyond. Recognizing the critical impact of the Taiwan question, Wang, during his meeting with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Washington, said that the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Strait is ""Taiwan independence"", and the most significant challenge to Sino-US relations, too, is ""Taiwan independence"", which should be resolutely opposed."
36,POSITIVE,0.8087732195854187,"Wang also made it clear during his meeting with US President Joe Biden that the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques are the pillars of bilateral ties and, therefore, should be firmly upheld. The principle and communiques highlight the political commitments of the US. Adhering to the principle and abiding by the three communiques will contribute to the proper handling of the Taiwan question and put Sino-US relations back on a healthy development track."
37,NEUTRAL,0.5306041836738586,"Since the Taiwan question is critical to the overall stability and positive development of Sino-US relations, it should be effectively managed based on the existing Sino-US political foundation. In recent years, the Taiwan Strait has come close to witnessing a conflict, often due to the instigation of certain US political forces which use the Taiwan question to fulfill their own narrow political goals, sending the wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" forces on the island."
38,NEUTRAL,0.49567222595214844,"The misguided signals from the US have emboldened the Taiwan secessionists. Combined with their increasing collusion with some US politicians, the misguided signals are the root cause of the complex and challenging situation across the Strait. It is the obligation of the US therefore to maintain peace and stability across the Strait. More important, the US should unequivocally oppose ""Taiwan independence"", in order to improve Sino-US relations and maintain peace and stability across the Strait."
39,NEUTRAL,0.6315597891807556,"The results of the upcoming elections in Taiwan early next year will be pivotal moments that could affect the political landscape of Taiwan, the situation across the Strait, and cross-Strait as well as Sino-US relations. They will also serve as a test of the US' commitment to the one-China principle."
40,NEUTRAL,0.5673676133155823,"The Taiwan question is critical to achieving the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. If the US fulfills its political commitments, upholds the one-China principle, opposes ""Taiwan independence"", and refrains from sending misguided signals to the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, the separatist forces on the island will think twice before making any rash moves. This in turn will pave the way for peace and stability across the Strait and the healthy development of cross-Strait relations. It will also contribute to the stability and sustainability of Sino-US relations and help prevent misunderstandings."
41,POSITIVE,0.7255741953849792,The US adhering to the one-China principle is not only in the interest of both China and the US and their peoples but also in line with the international community's expectations.

174,NEGATIVE,0.17866873741149902,"China, however, has cooperated with the US to, for example, reduce fentanyl abuse by banning the production and export of fentanyl and its analogues. And in 2019, China announced that it would add all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled drugs, making them illegal to manufacture, sell in the domestic market or export to other countries."
175,NEUTRAL,0.4709252119064331,"China and the US had been sharing intelligence and even conducting joint operations, but former US president Donald Trump's continued attacks against China has greatly undermined that cooperation. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his visit to China in June sought to revive the high-level cooperation, specifically to end fentanyl abuse. Both sides agreed to establish task forces to this effect, but this is still work in progress."
176,NEUTRAL,0.49670061469078064,"Of late, perhaps because both China and the US recognized that bilateral relations had hit rock bottom, there has been renewed engagement in this area in the past few months."
177,NEUTRAL,0.6076767444610596,"Both countries, indeed all countries, are facing common existential threats, and efforts to address them cannot be further deferred. Drug abuse is only one of the threats faced by the world, and not the most pressing. The ravages of climate change are increasing and worsening by the day, and only a Luddite would deny its devastating impacts on global society, especially on the environment."
178,NEUTRAL,0.5003737211227417,"According to scientists, a pandemic like COVID-19, perhaps more lethal, is no longer a question of if but when. The unleashing of ""generative artificial intelligence"" is also a cause for concern if not addressed now given that computers have been showing primitive signs that of starting to think for themselves."
