0,NEGATIVE,0.3389332592487335,"Enough is enough. What began as a seemingly reasonable Israeli retaliation for Hamas' attacks on the Jewish state on Oct 7 has gone too far. Israel's military offensive in Gaza has become increasingly indiscriminate with the bombing of refugee camps, besieging of hospitals and turning of the Palestinian enclave into a living inferno with appalling humanitarian tragedies happening on a daily basis."
1,NEGATIVE,0.07279085367918015,"According to reports, Al-Quds Hospital, Gaza's second-largest hospital, was forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel and the ongoing Israeli siege, which led to difficulties operating the facility. Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest hospital, was bombed and surrounded by tanks, and even temporarily cut off from the outside world."

Such a reckless and random offensive that makes no distinction between civilians and militants, and considers civilian life-support infrastructure a justified target for attack should be unconditionally condemned."
4,NEUTRAL,0.5136251449584961,Israel should know its forces' blatant disregard of international law and the ensuing humanitarian catastrophe it has wrought are quickly eroding the sympathy for its losses suffered at the beginning of this round of conflict.

5,NEUTRAL,0.4817315340042114,"Not only are Jewish settlers in the West Bank shooting to kill Palestinian civilians, Israel is fighting the Hezbollah on its northern border and bombing Syrian targets too.

If the fighting continues it can be only a matter of time before more players become directly involved, painting an even bleaker picture for peace and stability in the Middle East."
6,NEGATIVE,0.2864476442337036,"The current round of conflict is dragging into a second month, but rather than there being an end in sight, the situation is worsening day by day.

26,NEUTRAL,0.400417298078537,"Yuan Zheng, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of American Studies, said Blinken's meeting with regional partners in Asia was to show unity over major geopolitical issues and prevent existing differences on Gaza from deepening."
27,POSITIVE,0.743878960609436,"Yuan said that in recent years, the US has been reducing its military presence in the Middle East and shifted its strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region. Thus, the worsening of the conflict is not in its interest, especially when there is an increasing call for a humanitarian ceasefire from the global community. ""So, it is important for the US to keep communication with allies in Asia."""
28,POSITIVE,0.7233062982559204,"He Yun, an associate professor at Hunan University's School of Public Policy, said Blinken's trip reflected a clear recognition within the US government of the need to reassure allies of its commitment to the ""Indo-Pacific"", as some think that the US global strategy with a focus on Asia-Pacific would be distracted by the Gaza conflict."

39,POSITIVE,0.7124925255775452,Beijing and Washington should therefore make long-term efforts to broaden their perspective on security relations and promote the building of a community with a shared security responsibility for mankind.
40,NEUTRAL,0.45188701152801514,"The dilemma facing traditional security relations between China and the US is evident. In terms of geopolitical issues, the US, driven by a strategy of balancing power in the Atlantic and Pacific and fueled by the fear of China's rise and ideological differences, has employed a strategy of containment and encirclement by leveraging geopolitical tensions and collaborating with regional allies. As for economic and trade relations, the economic cooperation between the two countries has been confronted with challenges in political and security issues, ranging from a trade war to a tech war. In international security, there are differences in their positions on major geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict, and their consensus and coordinated actions in global governance have dwindled."
41,NEUTRAL,0.6440873742103577,"To break free from challenges in their traditional security relations, it is necessary for both sides to focus on higher dimensions, seeking more common ground in human security and expanding the space for interaction. Beyond the traditional challenges such as climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, major ecological challenges resulting from nuclear wastewater discharge, and humanitarian crises arising from local conflicts, have made the concept of human security, as outlined in the United Nations' Human Development Report 1994, even more relevant. In this new international environment, safeguarding human security, which includes political security, personal security, environmental security, food security, health security, economic security and community security, requires the international community, particularly the two major countries, to go beyond traditional notions and work toward the betterment of global human security while promoting the positive development of their own international relations."
42,NEUTRAL,0.6769267320632935,"China and the US have a responsibility and the ability to jointly safeguard human security. Threats to human security, such as climate change, the escalation of geopolitical conflicts, the risk of uncontrolled use of weapons of mass destruction, cybersecurity, ethical risks related to artificial intelligence and biotechnology and crimes against humanity, pose potential dangers far greater than the security threats that stem from conflicts in their real interests. Addressing these common security threats necessitates building a sense of shared responsibility between China and the US and establishing mechanisms for joint responsibility. Both countries, with their mature political systems, strong organizational and mobilization capabilities and leading strength in advanced technologies and culture, play pivotal roles in global governance."
43,NEUTRAL,0.662070631980896,"This provides a realistic basis for their cooperation over human security. In fact, both countries have conducted positive interactions in areas such as climate change, marine conservation, and public health, indicating the potential for consensus on human security."
44,NEUTRAL,0.4556289315223694,"Sino-US cooperation in the field of human security is still far from reaching a scope and level that matches the importance of this issue. The two sides have yet to establish a dialogue and negotiation mechanism for human security, and the academic community needs to delve deeper into this issue. In the face of uncertainties and challenges in traditional security cooperation, it is important for both countries to promote in-depth dialogue and cooperation from the perspective of their shared responsibility for human security."
45,NEUTRAL,0.6994472742080688,"It is necessary to incorporate the theme of human security into the bilateral diplomatic security dialogue mechanism. The China-US diplomatic security dialogue mechanism, first established in 2017, is a significant initiative.

46,NEGATIVE,0.2475023716688156,"Efforts should be made to solidify the economic foundation of China-US cooperation in human security. Human security encompasses the most fundamental security needs of humanity, and these needs drive supply. This logic provides ample space for mutual interaction between the two countries in the economic and financial sectors regarding human security. For example, both countries can engage in more pragmatic cooperation in areas such as infrastructure financing related to human security, food and healthcare products, large-scale disaster insurance, and personal insurance."
47,NEUTRAL,0.6988064050674438,"It is important to build up awareness of the need for a community with a shared responsibility for human security among the public. It is necessary to strengthen nongovernmental dialogues on security concepts and cooperation, organize exchanges at various levels, including young students, women's groups, and media organizations, on the issue of the shared responsibility for human security. Additionally, academic disciplines related to human security should be established in universities and research institutions to step up relevant research. By maximizing consensus on the shared responsibility for human security, the public support for building a community with a shared responsibility for human security can be strengthened, which could enable both governments to give more consideration to human security factors when formulating security policies."

49,NEUTRAL,0.4328804612159729,"It is imperative to strengthen cooperation in human security with a broader range of countries. Human security is not only a concern for China and the US, but also for the broader international community. It is necessary to strengthen dialogue, research, and cooperation in the field of human security with other countries, finding like-minded partners. For example, topics related to human security could be introduced within frameworks like the Belt and Road Initiative and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to explore governance approaches for cybersecurity, climate change, space and technological security and establish relevant cooperation mechanisms. The establishment of a thematic forum on the shared responsibility for human security will help maximize international consensus and enable breakthroughs in the field of human security."
50,NEUTRAL,0.561077892780304,"However, Sino-US cooperation over human security and working toward the building of a community with a shared responsibility for human security is bound to be a complex and challenging process. The biggest obstacle is the tendency to overstretch, politicize and ideologize issues related to universal human security from the perspective of unilateral interests. It is impossible to isolate human security issues from national security, and it is also important to recognize that such issues go beyond political and national domains to some extent. Therefore, building a community with a shared responsibility for human security between China and the US will help to break free from the challenges facing the two nations in their traditional security relations while opening up new chapters and channels for security interaction. This will help guide the positive development of China-US relations toward the building of a global community with a shared future."

China's policymakers have focused on providing liquidity support and measures to promote growth.

That will provide more room for prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policy to ensure a healthy and balanced economic recovery while upgrading the economic structure."
67,NEUTRAL,0.40979865193367004,Global supply chains have been subjected to multiple shocks over the past few years. The most notable one has been the three-year-long COVID-19 pandemic. The disruptions from the pandemic were compounded by the outbreak of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine in early 2022. The economic costs triggered by the disruption of food and energy supply chains are likely to increase because of the Israel-Palestine conflict now.
68,NEGATIVE,0.28009936213493347,"The Asia-Pacific region has been suffering from the above supply chain disruptions. It is also witnessing a rise in geopolitical tensions, arising out of the intense competition between the United States and China. The competition has resulted in the reorganization of several supply chains. These include those that have a direct impact on the national security of countries, such as semiconductors.

In manufacturing supply chains, China has been a key source of raw materials, intermediates, and the assembly of final products. Over time, it has also become an important endpoint of various supply chains because of its growth as a major global consumer market. The dual significance of China makes it difficult to visualize supply chain strategies that can achieve economic decoupling from China and yet yield business outcomes that are efficient."

One of the ways for making supply chains secure is to increase diversification in sourcing. If sourcing across important supply chains, such as semiconductors, food, energy, chemicals, automobiles etc. becomes more diverse, then it will be less vulnerable to risks because of supply disruptions in one or two sourcing locations. This will also ensure more stable health of the supply chains."
75,POSITIVE,0.7177364230155945,"From an Asia-Pacific perspective, diversification and de-risking are important objectives to pursue.
