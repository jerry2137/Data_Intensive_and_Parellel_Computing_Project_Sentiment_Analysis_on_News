While students are grappling with new knowledge, they are also dealing with new software pervasive in academic life – generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While each university and school has its own approach to the use of GenAI, in general, there are three areas in which students need to be cautious while using it in assessments."
115,POSITIVE,0.8405231833457947,"First and foremost, GenAI may provide fake or inaccurate information. Without scrutiny, students could easily include incorrect material in their assessments. This will not just adversely affect the quality of the assignment completed, but also the quality of learning."
116,POSITIVE,0.7937654256820679,"GenAI also sometimes generates false information to meet a prompt’s requirements. For example, GenAI may cite a completely made-up source in its answer. Therefore, students must cross-check the accuracy of the information GenAI provides."
117,POSITIVE,0.8209313154220581,"Second, GenAI can lead to plagiarism. The information it provides could be a direct copy without proper acknowledgement of the original source."
118,NEUTRAL,0.6890383362770081,"If plagiarism detection software discovers this in a submitted assignment, students, rather than GenAI, would be held responsible. Students should check the original source and make sure ideas are appropriately acknowledged."
119,NEGATIVE,0.3364991843700409,"Finally, GenAI cannot provide in-depth critical insight. GenAI can be applied to homework that involves summarising. But students may still need to write argumentative essays themselves."
120,NEGATIVE,0.3595369756221771,"If students rely on GenAI to create the entire essay from scratch, the submission won’t score well or may even be given a failing grade. Hence, students shouldn’t rely solely on GenAI."
121,NEGATIVE,0.14036481082439423,"After all, human brains cannot be replaced by computers. We still need to perform higher-order thinking on our own. If not, what’s the meaning of our existence?"
122,NEUTRAL,0.606734037399292,"I had the privilege after 2009 to work briefly for both the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and City University of Hong Kong, giving me insights into their projects. With regard to the recent double accreditation of the university’s veterinary school, I would like to inform readers that without the vision and dedication of Dr Howard Wong, the veterinary school would not have been established."
123,POSITIVE,0.7136479616165161,"Pathfinders are often misunderstood. They need to have the good fortune to receive the gift of highly skilled and excellent professionals to follow their lead. And this has occurred here. But credit where credit is due, and unlike many pathfinders, Dr Wong is really easy to get along with."
124,NEUTRAL,0.4950883090496063,"OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is exploring making its own artificial intelligence chips and has gone as far as evaluating a potential acquisition target, according to people familiar with the company’s plans."
125,NEUTRAL,0.41078880429267883,"The company has not yet decided to move ahead, according to recent internal discussions described to Reuters. However, since at least last year it discussed various options to solve the shortage of expensive AI chips that OpenAI relies on, according to people familiar with the matter."

ChatGPT will then produce audio of the text it generates in that voice – for example, reading an AI-generated bedtime story out loud."
