1,0.4785433113574981,0.04291337728500377,"""When I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign,"" said Scott, the only Black Republican senator, on a Fox News program."
2,0.3717817962169647,0.25643640756607056,The announcement came as a surprise for many of Scott's aides and donors although the South Carolina Republican was already struggling with poll numbers stagnating.
3,0.7742571234703064,0.5485142469406128,"According to CNN, following last week's third Republican presidential debate, the super political action committee supporting Scott decided not to make a new investment."
4,0.9219142198562622,0.8438284397125244,"""Tim Scott is a strong conservative with bold ideas about how to get our country back on track. I respect his courage to run this campaign and thank him for his service to America and the US Senate. I look forward to Tim continuing to be a leader in our party for years to come,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis responded with a post on X, formerly Twitter."
5,0.2218073308467865,0.556385338306427,Scott's departure from the Republican presidential race came roughly two weeks after former Vice President Mike Pence suspended his campaign in late October.
6,0.7378485798835754,0.4756971597671509,"The race has been dominated by former President Donald Trump, who is facing four criminal indictments."
7,0.5496588945388794,0.09931778907775879,"Editor's note: China and the US, as the two biggest economies globally, should overcome challenges and restore bilateral relations, which is not only crucial for both countries but also for the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. Three experts offer their insights to China Daily."
8,0.6676547527313232,0.3353095054626465,What does easing of Sino-US ties signify?
9,0.3926447629928589,0.21471047401428223,"High-level interactions between China and the United States have increased in recent months, fostering a warmer atmosphere. New dialogue mechanisms and communication channels have been established, including the creation of working groups to tackle economic, financial, and business issues. The two countries are also engaging in dialogue and negotiations on diplomacy, climate change, the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, arms control and nuclear non-proliferation."
10,0.395962506532669,0.20807498693466198,"Last month, Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited the US, laying the groundwork for the participation of President Xi Jinping in the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco from Nov 14 to 17 and the meeting between the Chinese and US leaders."
11,0.4619853496551513,0.07602930068969738,"Both Beijing and Washington are working to normalize bilateral ties, with the US reiterating its commitment to the one-China principle and its stance that doesn't support ""Taiwan independence"". The US side has stressed it does not seek ""decoupling"" from China, and the Joe Biden administration has extended the agreement between the two countries on cooperation in science and technology by six months. In a reciprocal gesture, China has signed agreements to make its first bulk purchase of US agricultural products in six years. That the deal is worth billions of dollars shows China's willingness to improve relations with the US."
12,0.6326990127563477,0.2653980255126953,"While there has been a slight improvement in Sino-US relations due to high-level interactions, it's important to realize that no substantial breakthrough has been achieved. Both countries are engaged in primary-level dialogue and communication, but a lack of strategic mutual trust has prevented the two sides from reaching a consensus on any issue, especially because the US is yet to take any substantial action to rebuild mutual trust."
13,0.3361164033412933,0.32776719331741344,"Also, the Biden administration continues to exert pressure on China by resorting to a two-pronged strategy. In August, Biden signed an executive order restricting investments in sensitive technology sectors such as semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, and demanded that US companies report their investments in other technology sectors in China to the US administration. And on Oct 17, the US Department of Commerce imposed new export controls, significantly restricting exports to China."
14,0.3493305742740631,0.3013388514518738,"Worse, the Biden administration approved a new economic deal with Taiwan, providing military assistance to the island through the presidential drawdown authority and then announcing the 11th round of arms sales to Taiwan, in a bid to support Taiwan in resisting reunification by force."
15,0.5375842452049255,0.07516849040985107,"On the South China Sea issue, the US continues to sow discord between China and its neighbors. It has strengthened its relations with Vietnam and is supporting the Philippines in its provocative moves at China's Ren'ai Reef. The US has also imposed illegal sanctions on Chinese officials citing the so-called Tibet issue, which is a direct interference in China's internal affairs."
16,0.8151152729988098,0.6302305459976196,"Besides, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after visiting China, said that it is no secret that there are differences between the US and China, and Washington will continue to stand for its interests, stand up for its values and continue to do things and say things that Beijing doesn't like."
17,0.7718101143836975,0.543620228767395,"The US' current policy toward China is a combination of engagement and dialogue alongside strategic competition. The dialogue helps the US in the strategic competition with China. In fact, the improvement in Sino-US relations can be largely attributed to the Biden administration's tactical adjustments in its policy toward China. The reasons behind these adjustments are not complex."
18,0.785489022731781,0.570978045463562,"First, Biden's moves are in response to concerns raised by rational voices within the US that have warned that the US' China policy is unbalanced, emphasizing that intensive competition with China leads to excessive tensions."
19,0.4501702785491943,0.09965944290161144,"Second, the Biden administration recognizes the need for China's cooperation to address various global issues, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, regional instability, climate change, economic and trade matters, international finance, and the opioid crisis in the US."
20,0.9296836256980896,0.8593672513961792,"Third, as the host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, the US is keen to demonstrate its global leadership and improve its international image. It attaches great importance to persuading China's top leadership to participate in the APEC event and arrange for a meeting between the two countries' leaders."
21,0.5918365716934204,0.18367314338684082,"And fourth, Biden is strategically positioning himself for the 2024 US presidential election. It is a known fact that China-related issues will feature prominently in the presidential debates next year, which makes Biden's approach toward China a strategic and tactical move rather than a fundamental shift in policy. In fact, the US has been adjusting its China policy since the Barack Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"" strategy."
22,0.5905224084854126,0.1810448169708252,"Whether from the perspective of the US' China policy, the current state of Sino-US relations or the US' domestic political landscape, the Biden administration does not intend to fundamentally change the current policy of taking a tough stance against China."
23,0.7673712372779846,0.5347424745559692,"As long as the US maintains its sense of superiority, its hegemonic mindset and its ideological biases toward China, it will not change its ""China-containment"" strategy."
24,0.5663676261901855,0.1327352523803711,"Given these facts, China should adopt a prudent strategy to manage both competition and cooperation with the US, even seeking cooperation through competition. China must always keep its interests in mind when seeking common ground with the US, and make it a priority to ensure that the US' ""five noes"" commitments (the US does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China's system, does not seek to confront China through strengthened alliances, does not support ""Taiwan independence"" and does not seek conflict with China) are realized, while also identifying areas where its interests intersect with those of the US to expand cooperation."
25,0.7651951313018799,0.5303902626037598,"Constructing a genuine safety barrier, as Biden intends to build, is essential to effectively preventing the escalation of Sino-US competition and conflicts. After all, a stable Sino-US relationship is in the interest of both nations and plays a pivotal role in global peace and regional stability."

28,0.4994202554225921,0.0011594891548157849,"In recent years, conflicts, disputes and other regional hotspot issues have caused uncertainty about the world's future. In all this, the Taiwan question stands out as one of the most prominent regional flashpoints, and it's a focal point in Sino-US relations."
29,0.6803317070007324,0.36066341400146484,"The collusion between separatist forces in Taiwan and certain US politicians and organizations have repeatedly escalated tensions in the Taiwan Strait. If not effectively addressed, the situation could spiral out of control, leading to disastrous consequences not only for the region but also for the entire world."
30,0.6816716194152832,0.3633432388305664,"The Taiwan question is a core interest of Beijing. Defending this core interest involves maintaining peace and stability across the Strait, opposing and eradicating all forms of ""Taiwan independence"" activities and external interference in the Taiwan question — in short, not allowing any force to separate Taiwan from the motherland."
31,0.760301411151886,0.520602822303772,"When it comes to matters of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese people and government have no room for compromise. No one should expect Beijing to accept the separation of Taiwan from the motherland."
32,0.6124700903892517,0.22494018077850342,"This is the 21st century, not the 19th or 20th century, a century when China has become an economic powerhouse and a big military power. So China will not allow its territory to be divided or its sovereignty to be violated."
33,0.4735604524612427,0.05287909507751465,"The Taiwan question has always been the most sensitive subject in Sino-US relations, affecting the nature and direction of this crucial bilateral relationship. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during his meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington on Oct 26-27, emphasized that the current global situation is complex, and Sino-US relations have reached a critical crossroad."
34,0.5243173241615295,0.04863464832305908,"In such a situation, the handling of the Taiwan question is a key indicator of in which way Sino-US relations will move. Ably managing the Taiwan question will contribute to the positive development of bilateral relations, benefiting China and the United States, as well as the Asia-Pacific region, and even the entire world."
35,0.6344816088676453,0.2689632177352905,"On the other hand, the mishandling of the Taiwan question could significantly increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Beijing and Washington, leading to instability in the Asia-Pacific and the world beyond. Recognizing the critical impact of the Taiwan question, Wang, during his meeting with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Washington, said that the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Strait is ""Taiwan independence"", and the most significant challenge to Sino-US relations, too, is ""Taiwan independence"", which should be resolutely opposed."
36,0.8087732195854187,0.6175464391708374,"Wang also made it clear during his meeting with US President Joe Biden that the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques are the pillars of bilateral ties and, therefore, should be firmly upheld. The principle and communiques highlight the political commitments of the US. Adhering to the principle and abiding by the three communiques will contribute to the proper handling of the Taiwan question and put Sino-US relations back on a healthy development track."
37,0.5306041836738586,0.061208367347717285,"Since the Taiwan question is critical to the overall stability and positive development of Sino-US relations, it should be effectively managed based on the existing Sino-US political foundation. In recent years, the Taiwan Strait has come close to witnessing a conflict, often due to the instigation of certain US political forces which use the Taiwan question to fulfill their own narrow political goals, sending the wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" forces on the island."
38,0.4956722259521484,0.008655548095703236,"The misguided signals from the US have emboldened the Taiwan secessionists. Combined with their increasing collusion with some US politicians, the misguided signals are the root cause of the complex and challenging situation across the Strait. It is the obligation of the US therefore to maintain peace and stability across the Strait. More important, the US should unequivocally oppose ""Taiwan independence"", in order to improve Sino-US relations and maintain peace and stability across the Strait."
39,0.6315597891807556,0.26311957836151123,"The results of the upcoming elections in Taiwan early next year will be pivotal moments that could affect the political landscape of Taiwan, the situation across the Strait, and cross-Strait as well as Sino-US relations. They will also serve as a test of the US' commitment to the one-China principle."
40,0.5673676133155823,0.13473522663116455,"The Taiwan question is critical to achieving the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. If the US fulfills its political commitments, upholds the one-China principle, opposes ""Taiwan independence"", and refrains from sending misguided signals to the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, the separatist forces on the island will think twice before making any rash moves. This in turn will pave the way for peace and stability across the Strait and the healthy development of cross-Strait relations. It will also contribute to the stability and sustainability of Sino-US relations and help prevent misunderstandings."
41,0.7255741953849792,0.4511483907699585,The US adhering to the one-China principle is not only in the interest of both China and the US and their peoples but also in line with the international community's expectations.

77,0.635510265827179,0.2710205316543579,"The BRI has come a long way since its launch. That more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations have signed more than 230 cooperation agreements with China under the initiative means countries, which combined account for three-quarters of the world's population, are involved in the initiative. Many infrastructure projects and forms of cooperation have already become a reality in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America in the first decade of the initiative's existence."
78,0.7654494643211365,0.530898928642273,"The initiative is expected to help China to realize the second centenary goal of building a modern socialist country and achieve the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation by the middle of the century, with 2049 being the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China."
79,0.7511551976203918,0.5023103952407837,"There are already indicators of why this might be the case. One is the outcome of the domestic development policy that led to the eradication of absolute poverty at the end of 2020. The BRI is moving in the same direction as the Global Development Initiative to eradicate absolute poverty in China, and its aim is to raise the living standards of people around the world."
80,0.7418200373649597,0.48364007472991943,"The BRI is entering a new phase, its second decade of existence. In order to comprehend the initiative's role in this new period, it is important to understand how it will have to cope with a changed international situation. The current situation is different from that when the initiative was launched in 2013. There are at least three reasons for the change."
81,0.7405471801757812,0.4810943603515625,"First, the effects of the global financial crisis and the subsequent structural changes only began to be felt in the United States and other Western countries after 2016 with the rise of former US president Donald Trump, who imposed ill-advised trade sanctions on China and other countries, with the incumbent Joe Biden administration continuing that strategy."
82,0.8076267838478088,0.6152535676956177,"Second, the COVID-19 pandemic was a stress test and a new experience for countries engaged in global cooperation and competition."

84,0.3497162163257599,0.3005675673484802,"In this new phase of heightened tensions, it is important how the most vulnerable countries, that is, developing ones, stand up. Developing countries have the highest number of poor people and people who are at risk of falling into poverty. That is why development policies play a crucial role in economic growth and social progress, whether it is a development policy such as the BRI or an international cooperation-cum-development policy promoted by BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — which will be joined by Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Jan 1)."
85,0.5047776103019714,0.009555220603942871,"In this situation, developing countries are reinforcing each other. The inclusion of six more countries — from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America — in BRICS will boost the group's cooperation with other countries and pave the way for the BRICS member states to use their own currencies for intra-BRICS Plus trade, thus reducing the dominance of the US dollar and other Western currencies, and contributing to the development of the Global South."
86,0.4584722518920898,0.08305549621582042,The need to strengthen themselves prompted the old BRICS member states to include more countries to extend the grouping's influence across the world. But we should keep in mind that this expansion will not continue to the extent of including all the developing countries in BRICS Plus.
87,0.8984959721565247,0.7969919443130493,"The developing world is currently represented the broadest in the G77. The more focused BRICS Plus organization represents an important core of the most influential developing countries on their respective continents. The BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, from Aug 22 to 24 and the G77 Summit in Cuba on Sept 15-16 demonstrated these facts."
88,0.8939355611801147,0.7878711223602295,"It is in this context that China is promoting the BRI, whose goal is to improve infrastructure connectivity.

94,0.3355931341648102,0.32881373167037964,"Its name signals condemnation of the unjust killings of black people by the police (black people are far more likely to be killed by the police than white people in the US) and the demand that society value the lives and humanity of the black people as much as it values those of the white people. Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013 by three black community organizers after George Zimmerman, a man of German and Peruvian descent, was acquitted on charges stemming from his fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012."

At least 1,176 people were killed by police officers last year, according to a project called Mapping Police Violence — the most since experts began tracking police violence — with the black people accounting for 24 percent of the deaths although they comprise only 13 percent of the total US population."
99,0.4925997257232666,0.014800548553466797,"Most shockingly, less than 0.3 percent of the police officers responsible for the deaths between 2013 and 2022 have been convicted.

Police brutality against minorities is unlikely to be curbed in the near future. Under the pretext of maintaining ""law and order"", the governments have cracked down on anti-racism movements.

112,0.5776658654212952,0.15533173084259033,"There is no doubt that the world has become substantially better since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the US in 1979. From virtually no contact before 1971, China and the US had established 90 bilateral high-level dialogue mechanisms in the following decades covering almost all fields, from strategic, economic and trade to intellectual property rights protection and people-to-people exchanges. I covered many of those events during the years I was posted in the US from 2009 to 2018."
113,0.1827245652675628,0.6345508694648744,"US officials, pundits and news media were lying when they claimed China, in the past few years, had rejected high-level talks with the United States. They forgot that it was former US president Donald Trump who canceled almost all these bilateral mechanisms."
114,0.683901309967041,0.36780261993408203,The Joe Biden administration should show more courage to put bilateral ties on the normal track. Biden and many of his administration's officials participated in the dialogues every year and applauded them when they were serving in the Barack Obama administration.
115,0.3819286823272705,0.23614263534545898,"Dialogue and contacts are essential to prevent bilateral relations from going into free fall into a new Cold War and, worse, even a hot war. If the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts are devastating, a conflict between the world's two largest economies and military powers will be catastrophic for not just China and the US, but the entire world too."
116,0.8379813432693481,0.6759626865386963,"However, talks and visits alone are not enough to put bilateral ties back on track. For that to happen, Washington has to change its national security strategy which views China as its ""biggest threat"". The US' China-containment policy has undermined the bilateral relationship. The US has been waging reckless tariff, trade and tech wars against China, and rallying and coercing US allies to join it to form a ""formidable"" front against China to check its peaceful rise."
117,0.5026814341545105,0.005362868309020996,"The US which has, for decades, lectured China and other countries on the benefits of an open global economy, free and fair trade and economic globalization has now resorted to protectionism and unilateralism."
118,0.7405443787574768,0.4810887575149536,"In particular, the US has been playing with fire on the Taiwan question, by changing the status quo many a time during the Trump and Biden administrations, a move that breaches China's redline. Anyone who understands China's history and the Chinese psyche knows that such US provocations are indeed dangerous."
119,0.3582935333251953,0.2834129333496094,"The US is desperate to contain China economically by cracking down on Chinese tech companies and put them on its Entity List and restricting exports to China, but such Cold War-era measures will only slow down China's rise in the short term. In the long run, China will emerge stronger just like the rapid development of China's military industry in the face of the US' and the European Union's arms embargo against China."
120,0.399598091840744,0.20080381631851196,"The US' tariff, trade and tech wars against China have hurt many US companies and consumers given that China is a manufacturing powerhouse and the largest trade partner of more than 120 countries and regions.

140,0.7550801038742065,0.5101602077484131,"After taking office in 2021, US President Joe Biden largely inherited the national security strategy of the Donald Trump era, which is to tackle challenges to the US' global hegemony. To this end, the Biden administration withdrew US troops from Afghanistan in 2021, putting an end to its 20-year global war on terrorism. As a result, Pakistan, which served as a ""front-line nation"" in the United States' war against terror, has become less important to the US, while its neighbor India has become a close partner of the US thanks to its high geopolitical value."
141,0.6510552167892456,0.3021104335784912,"In February 2022, the US released its ""Indo-Pacific strategy"", which recognized India as ""a like-minded partner"", ""a leader in South Asia and the Indian Ocean"", ""a driving force of the QUAD and other regional fora"" and ""an engine for regional growth and development"" and supported ""India's continued rise and regional leadership"".Likewise, the US National Security Strategy gave priority to ""promoting a free and open 'Indo-Pacific'"" in its strategy by region.

The two sides condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The Chinese side recognized Pakistan's contributions and sacrifices in combating terrorism and the two sides agreed to further enhance counter-terrorism cooperation to promote world peace and security."

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor will grow into an important vehicle and foundation for the two countries to support each other in a changing world, and will bring more benefits to people of the two nations through win-win cooperation."

Since establishing diplomatic ties in 1979, total trade between the two countries has grown from $2 billion to over $643.8 billion in 2022. China-US two-way equity and bond holdings at the end of 2020 stood at $3.3 trillion. This complex relationship underpins numerous sectors and millions of livelihoods. In 2019, exports to China supported 1.2 million jobs in the US and as of 2018,197,000 people in the US were directly employed by Chinese multinational firms, according to the US-China Business Council."

In 2022 alone, the coffee chain opened 724 new shops on the Chinese mainland, increasing its total number of stores to well over 6,000. Even amid political tensions, US investment in China increased by 9 percent year-on-year in 2022."
158,0.2353574931621551,0.5292850136756898,"These numbers show how deeply the economies of the two countries rely on each other, but it also means that disruptions could thus wreak havoc. A Rhodium Group study found that if the US were to impose 25 percent tariffs on all goods traded with China, the US would lose $190 billion in annual GDP by 2025. In the US aviation industry alone, a complete loss of access to China's market for US aircraft and commercial aviation services could create US output losses ranging from $38 billion to $51 billion annually, with cumulative impacts adding up to $875 billion by 2038."
159,0.4252445995807647,0.14951080083847057,"US trade actions have already hurt its own consumers. The Donald Trump-era tariffs on Chinese imports raised costs for US manufacturers and consumers and led to retaliatory duties on US exports. A study conducted by Trade Partnership Worldwide found that if a 25 percent tariff were imposed on all Chinese imports, the average US family of four would pay up to $2,300 more per year for goods and services. This was particularly damning at a time when US inflation is at its highest level. Pursuing further trade decoupling, via expanded tariffs or restrictions, would only deepen the economic wounds."

Severing collaborative veins in science and technology not only threatens economies, but also human progress itself. China supplies the most foreign talent nourishing US graduate programs in cutting-edge fields. Meanwhile, US tech giants, such as Apple, which reaped $74 billion from China in 2022, are inextricably tied to Chinese ecosystems and markets. Compartmentalizing research frontiers such as artificial intelligence, robotics and biotech imperils breakthroughs that uplift humanity."

The shared destiny of the two countries demands they reject fatal zero-sum thinking that sacrifices advancement on the altar of insular mistrust. By cooperating, they honor not just mutual interests but the human yearning to learn and explore."
162,0.4122134447097778,0.17557311058044445,"When it comes to security issues, China and the US must resist the temptation of brinkmanship. Both nations possess substantial nuclear arsenals, meaning any military conflict runs the risk of rapid escalation to the nuclear level. Even a nonnuclear war conducted with today's conventional weapons could result in catastrophic damage and loss of life on both sides. Neither side should forget that war between nuclear powers is unwinnable — the consequences would be horrific beyond measure for the entire world. Statesmanship and pragmatism are essential to safeguarding prosperity and human progress."
163,0.2988176643848419,0.40236467123031616,"Equally, global challenges such as climate change demand China-US coordination. Both China and the US are global leaders in renewable energy development, investments and deployments. In particular, China's efforts to expand its solar and wind power capacities will contribute in a large part to an expected one-third growth in global renewable energy capacity in 2023. With the two nations generating nearly 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, hopes of restricting global warming hinge on the urgent alignment of China-US policies. Neither can tackle such transnational threats alone."

Similarly, the fissures in China-US relations could cause catastrophic results if left unaddressed. Tensions are reaching dangerous levels across trade, technology and security. Yet both countries remain bound by mutual interest in prosperity and stability. Blindly decoupling courts calamity — sundering the world economy's most vital arteries, crashing markets, and breeding mistrust and miscalculation between two nuclear superpowers. Wisdom lies in carefully identifying strategic areas for cooperation to shore up the foundations."

The hour is late but opportunity remains for us to converge in defense of humanity's future. Progress depends on expanding our moral imaginations beyond suspicion and zero-sum thinking toward empathy, foresight and care. We face a stark choice — sleepwalk into catastrophe or, in Abraham Lincoln's words, summon the better angels of our nature. The future beckons great powers to choose peace."

He then progressed to more potent alcoholic drinks. He ""graduated"" to opioid abuse and became addicted to painkillers such as OxyContin. He spent half his life in rehabilitation, attended more than 6,000 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and spent more than $9 million trying to tame his addiction. But the abuse of legal drugs, legally or illegally obtained, pales in comparison to illegally produced drugs."

But the fact is, the US, cannot get its house in order, as Perry's case shows, even with drugs that are legally manufactured. Why? You don't have to be a drug expert to know the reason. Being an economist is sufficient. To put it simply, it's a matter of supply and demand. The US demand for drugs has kept increasing, with supply, too, increasing to meet the demand."

174,0.178668737411499,0.642662525177002,"China, however, has cooperated with the US to, for example, reduce fentanyl abuse by banning the production and export of fentanyl and its analogues. And in 2019, China announced that it would add all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled drugs, making them illegal to manufacture, sell in the domestic market or export to other countries."
