In the end the printing press did enable harms – the publication of a witch-hunting manual in 1486 paved the way for centuries of persecution of women suspected to be witches – but they were utterly dwarfed by its enlightenment benefits.

First is its scale: AI has left Moore’s Law, which predicted computing power would double every two years, standing. The most cutting-edge AI today is 5bn times more powerful than that of a decade ago. So yes, AI will increase productivity and fundamentally change the nature of human work, like its predecessor technologies, but at a pace we’ve never seen before. While technology hasn’t ever eroded the need for human labour – new jobs have been created as others have ceased to exist – it has concentrated economic power and fuelled inequality. Are our political systems ready for this?"

Autonomous AI models are in development that can pursue high-level goals; but can developers predict how they will develop themselves once unleashed on the world, and what’s to stop AI pursuing goals that don’t align with societal interests? With social media companies, we’ve seen what happens when their profit motives incentivise them to create harm through pushing polarising content and disinformation; this has proved hard enough to regulate despite the fact this is an easily understood, predictable phenomenon."

Existing large language models like Chat GPT already churn out hard-to-spot disinformation complete with fake citations; in the wrong hands they could play havoc with our ability to distinguish truth from propaganda. There is dark scope for AI chatbots to develop coercively controlling relationships with humans and to manipulate or radicalise them into doing terrible things; the 21-year-old man sentenced to nine years in prison this month for breaking into Windsor Castle with a crossbow in 2021 was in conversation with an AI “friend” that encouraged him to carry out the attack. Earlier this year, a Belgian man with mental health issues who took his own life was goaded to do so by a chatbot.

The answer is clear with aviation or nuclear power; less so with AI. A lack of agreed definition has blighted attempts to regulate social media; and while there will be global consensus on some things, there will be values-based disagreement on others; China this year introduced tough regulations for ChatGPT-style AI that mandate companies to uphold “core socialist values”."

239,0.7836798429489136,0.5673596858978271,"One of the indignities of the digital age is being asked, constantly, to confirm we are who we say we are, that we are indeed a human being. Something feels slightly amiss when the (non-human) technology demands that we convince it that we are not the same as them. Big (and sometimes overexcited) claims are being made for artificial intelligence, the most recent being the claim from Wharton business school in Philadelphia that ChatGPT is more creative than human beings (well, more creative than MBA students, anyway)."
240,0.70564866065979,0.4112973213195801,"Students and AI were challenged to come up with ideas for new, cheap products. When potential customers were surveyed online, the products suggested by AI seemed to be more popular. They had certainly been dreamed up much more quickly and in larger numbers than the ideas put forward by mere humans."
241,0.7195354104042053,0.43907082080841064,"Digging into the research, however, caused this particular human being to experience a jolt of scepticism. In a footnote, the researchers concede there are concerns that AI is being used to provide answers for these online consumer panels. Are robots passing judgment on robots? “We believe that we were indeed surveying humans,” the researchers say."
242,0.7173218727111816,0.4346437454223633,"When I looked at the list of “new” products – “multifunctional desk organiser”, “noise-cancelling headphones”, “compact printer” – they did not exactly scream “innovation”. Indeed, the researchers admit the ideas produced by the students scored higher for novelty. But they dismissed the idea that novelty was necessarily an advantage in new product creation."

The Renaissance was in part a conscious attempt to imitate and recreate the art of antiquity. Originality is a slippery concept, as any good intellectual property lawyer will tell you – for a fee."
244,0.809886634349823,0.619773268699646,"The Wharton researchers try not to over-claim. AI could become “a creative co-pilot”, they say. “Together, you can become a more innovative team.” The tech writer Kate Bevan agrees with that last point. You can use AI as “a way to express creativity, but AI itself is not creative”, she told me."

I gawped up at the ceiling, as so many millions of people have done in the five centuries since the decorator finished his work there in 1512. The “decorator” Michelangelo."

249,0.7514966130256653,0.5029932260513306,"You don’t have to believe in a divine spark. But when Adam reaches out like that he is, I think, doing what all of us try to do, one way or another, every day. He is trying to be creative, to be human. He is seeking inspiration. He is not a robot. He is something much better than that: infinite, full of potential, unpredictable."
250,0.8601904511451721,0.7203809022903442,"The new technology is great: exciting, powerful, also full of potential. But I think we living things ought to remain in charge. On behalf of humanity, I would respectfully ask some of the more overexcited tech bros: prove you’re not the idiot."
