But a fundamental question facing the AI sector in China and elsewhere is how these novel and still imperfect technologies can be monetized. It's also a question weighing on the minds of Chinese investors, as the recent AI frenzy in the local stock market cools."
5,0.3908884227275848,0.21822315454483043,"China faces several challenges in the global AI race. Not least is the United States' ban on exports of the leading-edge semiconductors needed to power the fastest and most advanced AI solutions. The resulting supply chain bottlenecks will be a fixed hurdle for developing better foundation models (large language models like OpenAI's GPT). On the other hand, Chinese firms arguably have an edge over their foreign competitors when it comes to the massive amount of data they are able to access with comparative ease from consumers and other sources in China — although this could change if data privacy rules are tightened or consumers grow less willing to hand over their personal data."

The main difference is that the human in the driver's seat is not a driver, but a ""safety supervisor"" who only touches the steering wheel when absolutely necessary. According to Baidu, its robo-taxi service has offered more than 3.3 million rides in China. And now the service is in the midst of a technological upgrade: the tech giant has recently started deploying fully autonomous taxis — with no human staff inside — in four cities including Beijing."

Although Chinese mainland's graphic processing units can't compete with those from overseas suppliers, manufacturers of servers and printed circuit boards may see increasing demand driven by the shift to AI solutions.

In market segments facing intense competition, like consumer apps, copycats will put downward pressure on profit margins for innovators who shoulder huge computing costs. Chinese consumers may be less willing to pay for software solutions than their counterparts in the US or other markets. Despite these risks, we believe China's AI consumer apps may be better placed to monetize than enterprise apps, given the size and ease of access to the consumer base, and how accustomed people are to adopting new digital solutions. There may, of course, be unique setbacks along AI's development path in China, but these are a feature, not a bug, of innovation."
