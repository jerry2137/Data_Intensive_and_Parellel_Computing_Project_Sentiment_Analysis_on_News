1,0.822937548160553,0.645875096321106,Huawei has launched a new electric vehicle (EV) that is designed to take on Elon Musk’s Tesla.
2,0.2465946674346923,0.5068106651306155,"The Chinese tech giant began taking preorders of the Luxeed S7, its first sedan, on Thursday. Previously, it had sold SUVs."
3,0.2633679211139679,0.4732641577720642,"The car, which has developed with Chinese automaker Chery, has a starting price of 258,000 yuan ($35,400) during the presales period. Regular sales will begin on November 28, the company said at a press conference on Thursday."
4,0.6256382465362549,0.25127649307250977,"“In all honesty, I think comparisons with the Model S may be a bit ambitious on most metrics that I can find information for,” he told CNN, noting that some performance metrics had not been fully released."
5,0.37461918592453,0.25076162815094005,"“Where the S7 does stand out though is the 800-volt platform, which should enable very fast charging. Tesla [doesn’t] yet use an 800-volt platform, so the S7 will have an edge in this area,” Rainford said."
6,0.3957287669181824,0.20854246616363525,"The S7’s 800-volt battery pack, the thinnest in the industry according to Yu, is made by Chinese EV battery giant CATL."
7,0.5376318097114563,0.0752636194229126,"A 15-minute charge will yield a driving range of 400 kilometers (249 miles), according to Yu, which surpasses the 347-kilometer range (about 216 miles) for Tesla’s Model S after a similar charging period."
8,0.930217444896698,0.860434889793396,"“Our range exceeds the level of our peers,” he added."
9,0.3091665804386139,0.3816668391227722,"The US automaker, which no longer maintains a public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
10,0.3253839313983917,0.34923213720321655,"Rainford said while the range comparison had not been tested, it was possible due to the battery."
11,0.6523955464363098,0.30479109287261963,"Tesla may have an advantage because of its strong Supercharger network in China, which has many stations, he said."
12,0.3593440353870392,0.28131192922592163,"“Ease of finding a good charger … is of as much importance as its ability,” Rainford said."
13,0.3505356311798095,0.29892873764038097,"However, at the equivalent of $35,400, the S7 is much cheaper than the most basic Model S, which costs 698,900 yuan or $95,800 in China."
14,0.2128201872110366,0.5743596255779269,Tesla has been forced to slash prices in China recently in response to rising competition in the world’s biggest auto market.
15,0.7049063444137573,0.40981268882751465,"Although Huawei first made its name as a tech and telecoms giant, it has been hobbled in recent years by US export restrictions, which sent the company into a tailspin."
16,0.8937695026397705,0.787539005279541,"This year, it has made no secret of its ambition to make a comeback — and create a splash in the car world. It launched its first EV in 2021."
17,0.6472766995429993,0.29455339908599854,"At a September event, the company teased the release of the S7 as well as the Aito M9, an electric SUV developed with another Chinese automaker, Seres."
18,0.474660575389862,0.05067884922027599,"Yu said at the launch event that an upgraded version of the Aito M7, which was first released last year, had received more than 86,000 preorders in just 50 days."
19,0.5108286738395691,0.021657347679138184,"The S7 caters to female consumers — with a designated cosmetics drawer, mirror for touching up makeup and a place to stash away high heels when they’re ditched in favor of flat shoes for driving — according to Huawei."
20,0.4903308749198913,0.019338250160217396,"Just over a year ago, Alphonzo Terrell received an email letting him know he’d been laid off from Twitter."
21,0.4756309390068054,0.04873812198638916,"Terrell – who’d spent three years heading the platform’s social and editorial teams – was among the roughly 3,700 employees let go from the company on Nov. 4, 2022, just a week after Elon Musk closed his $44 billion Twitter acquisition. That day, Terrell tweeted that it was “time to build something new,” and then got on the phone with friend and former colleague DeVaris Brown."
22,0.4474985003471374,0.10500299930572521,"“I called him and I said, ‘I think it’s time to build and if we do this together, I think this can be really successful,’” Terrell, who’s also known as “Phonz” online, told CNN in an interview in September."
23,0.9393634796142578,0.8787269592285156,"Within hours, Terrell and Brown had laid out plans to launch a new app capitalizing on their experience building communities online and thwarting some of the typical problems known to plague legacy social media platforms. They wanted it to be everything most social media struggles to be: positive, safe and inclusive. They named it Spill, a nod to the phrase “spill the tea,” which refers to sharing gossip or information."
24,0.5530517101287842,0.10610342025756836,"Terrell for years has been working at the intersection of tech, media and culture, largely behind the scenes. Now he’s making a big bet on a concept tried by other social networks before, but which has consistently fallen short: Create a safe, rewarding and financially successful platform for Black, LGBTQ+ and other historically marginalized users."
25,0.5938229560852051,0.18764591217041016,"Those users, he says, often play an outsized role in driving online culture but are more likely to face harassment, like threats of violence or attacks on their identity, or to have others profit from their ideas. Spill is open to anyone, but by focusing on serving communities typically marginalized online, including with new content moderation and creator payment strategies, Terrell believes, the experience on the platform will be better for all of its users."
26,0.3990558087825775,0.20188838243484497,"Such a platform is even more important, Spill’s leadership believes, in the wake of Musk’s takeover at Twitter. Under the billionaire’s leadership, policy updates, changes to content moderation practices and controversial statements from Musk himself have led to a reported rise in hate speech on the platform and left many users searching for alternatives. And as the user base of the platform now known as X splinters, so does Black Twitter, the community of Black users that was a big part of Twitter’s growth and culture. Terrell wants to create a home for those users on Spill."
27,0.7849316000938416,0.5698632001876831,"Alphonzo ""Phonz"" Terrell is the CEO and co-founder of Spill, which he hopes will be a safer, more inclusive social platform for a diverse community of users."
28,0.7971321940422058,0.5942643880844116,"But Spill is clear that it’s not trying to recreate Twitter, or any other existing platform."
29,0.5392786264419556,0.07855725288391113,"Still, as legacy platforms have repeatedly learned the hard way, building a safe social network is not easy, especially as bad actors are becoming more sophisticated. Beyond safety, Spill also faces steep competition from the scores of new platforms that have launched in the year since Musk bought Twitter."
30,0.5790575742721558,0.15811514854431152,"During his time at Twitter, Terrell effectively served as the voice of the brand, with his team in charge of, among other things, running the company’s own accounts on the platform. Prior to Twitter, he worked in digital and social marketing for major brands such as HBO and Showtime."
31,0.7885949015617371,0.5771898031234741,"In those roles, Terrell saw what kinds of content and creators drove conversations on the platform, which he says gives him a leg up in building a new social media app."
32,0.7048001885414124,0.4096003770828247,"Terrell bonded with co-founder Brown — a developer who’s spent time at tech giants like Intel, Cisco and Microsoft and helped to found several tech startups — during their first-day orientation at Twitter, as two of the few people of color in their on-boarding group."
33,0.8186469078063965,0.637293815612793,"Since that first conversation about launching a new app last year, Terrell and Brown have built a powerhouse early team, including Reign and brand strategy and culture pro Kenya Parham, who is serving as Spill’s vice president of community and partnerships."
34,0.5448691844940186,0.08973836898803711,Spill co-founders Alphonzo Terrell (left) and DeVaris Brown devised the concept for the app the night of Elon Musk's mass layoffs at Twitter.
35,0.741627037525177,0.483254075050354,"“That’s been one of the most exciting and special things that we’ve seen happening so far is the community really taking ownership of the platform teaching us what they want,” Terrell said."
36,0.4579076468944549,0.0841847062110902,"The app is designed to be something “between a group chat … and a meme machine, so that you can create and express yourself in real time using visuals and using the native language of the internet,” according to Terrell. The feed features posts with large, block text, often superimposed over images or GIFs; on certain posts, users can swipe through to view a series of images. At the top of users’ feeds is the “Spillboard,” which highlights trending posts and is meant to help elevate creators on the app, Terrell said."
37,0.9277451038360596,0.8554902076721191,"And beyond its design choices, Terrell said Spill is aiming to cultivate a more positive, upbeat culture than Twitter and other social platforms."
38,0.3953485488891601,0.2093029022216798,"It’s a tack that other platforms have also tried to take, but it often proves difficult to carry out in practice, especially when they’re reliant on boosting engagement to appease advertisers."
39,0.5253140330314636,0.050628066062927246,"Still, Spill’s users are already connecting with its culture, which some say feels distinct Twitter, where inflammatory or polarizing content is often the most likely to gain strong engagement and be promoted by the platform’s algorithms."
40,0.3634636998176574,0.27307260036468517,"Since its iOS beta version launched in June, more than 200,000 users have signed up for Spill and another 200,000 have joined the waitlist. Spill in July hit the top of the Apple App Store’s most popular social apps list. Spill’s userbase remains far smaller than competitors like X (which has somewhere around 250 million daily active users) and Meta’s Threads (which has 100 million monthly active users), but the sign-ups have exceeded Spill’s initial expectations. The company’s original goal had been to have 100,000 users by the end of 2023."
41,0.5369743704795837,0.07394874095916748,"Already, Terrell said, 44% of Spill’s users posted on the platform within 12 hours of joining, and users create, on average, 14 posts (called “spills”) and comments per day."
42,0.8383652567863464,0.6767305135726929,"Spill has also raised more than $5 million from investors including the Kapor Center for Social Impact and Mac Venture Capital. And the company, which for now plans to have a largely ad-based business, has already inked ad deals with the likes of Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime and VH1."
43,0.7566146850585938,0.5132293701171875,"Even with the best intentions, keeping social networks safe is often easier said than done."
44,0.2954882681369781,0.4090234637260438,"Legacy social media platforms have repeatedly failed to anticipate how their products might be manipulated or misused until something goes wrong. Despite years of scrutiny and improvements by existing social platforms, women and people of color are still far more likely to say they’d been harassed online for their gender or their race, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center report. Members of the LGBTQ+ community also face disproportionate abuse online."
45,0.5005725026130676,0.001145005226135254,"That’s why, Terrell said, Spill is working to build safety into the app from day one."
46,0.6403532028198242,0.28070640563964844,"Among its efforts to improve the experience for users, the company is completely rethinking content moderation. Spill has a team of human moderators, and it’s also working on developing a new large language AI content moderation model to help monitor its systems that’s written by members of Black, LGBTQ+ and other historically marginalized communities."
47,0.8250566124916077,0.6501132249832153,"Alphonzo Terrell, co-founder of the social media app Spill, demonstrates how the platform works during an interview with CNN."
48,0.433793306350708,0.13241338729858398,"Even with AI content moderation models, other social media companies often fail to catch harmful content that makes it onto their platforms. But Terrell hopes that by involving the people most likely to face abuse online in its training, Spill’s model will be a step in the right direction."
49,0.6099994778633118,0.21999895572662354,"“So Black folks, queer folks, other groups that face these challenges, are inputting into this model so that it can be extremely technically sound and also culturally savvy, which we really haven’t seen before,” Terrell said."
50,0.2257354110479354,0.5485291779041293,"Violat﻿ors of Spill’s rules, including posting dangerous content such as violent threats, will be removed and could result in account bans, according to the platform’s rules. Less severe rules violations, such as “posting a misleading rumor,” could result in a user having some of the app’s features (like the ability to “quote” and reshare other posts) disabled, Spill says. And repeat violators of the platform’s rules will also risk having their accounts removed."
51,0.8162281513214111,0.6324563026428223,"“We have had about 20 years of social media to learn from, and we wanted to take lessons from that and apply them going forward to really unleash the next generation of social, which we think can be far more beneficial, entertaining, rewarding,” Terrell said."
52,0.5775718092918396,0.1551436185836792,"Investors will also be looking for that next-gen social platform to be profitable, and the potential is there for a company that’s catering to the users making the most engaging content on the internet, said Latoya Lee, an assistant professor at California State University Fullerton who has studied Black Twitter."
53,0.521319568157196,0.04263913631439209,"In the meantime, Spill is also working to set itself apart from competitor platforms that also emerged in the wake of Musk’s Twitter takeover, including Mastodon, Bluesky and Threads. What’s more, Spill is staying focused on a targeted audience at a time when many larger platforms are increasingly focused on trying to provide something for anyone."
54,0.7633404731750488,0.5266809463500977,"Brace yourselves. Jokes incoming. Elon Musk has announced the introduction of “Grok,” an artificially intelligent chatbot, for some users of X, which the billionaire suggests has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own."
55,0.4866524338722229,0.0266951322555542,"Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year, announced late Saturday that Grok is being trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform."
56,0.6872414946556091,0.37448298931121826,"Musk’s AI startup, xAI, which developed the bot, said in a blogpost that it took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams."
57,0.5038350820541382,0.007670164108276367,"“Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” xAI said in its blogpost."
58,0.3817396461963653,0.2365207076072694,"The bot is still in an early stage of testing, Musk said﻿, but will soon be made available to subscribers of X’s Premium+ service, who, in the United States, pay $16 a month for features such as the once-coveted blue checkmark."
59,0.3618275225162506,0.2763449549674988,"Grok is intended to rival ChatGPT, an AI chatbot released to the public by its maker OpenAI last November to much fanfare. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but stepped down as chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the co﻿mpany’s direction."
60,0.2951547801494598,0.40969043970108043,"In its blogpost, xAI said the large language model (LLM) — the type of system used to train AI applications — underpinning Grok-1 had outstripped the capabilities of GPT-3.5, the LLM that trains the publicly available version of ChatGPT, on several measures, including solving some high school math problems."
61,0.6791905164718628,0.3583810329437256,"“It is only surpassed by models that were trained with a significantly larger amount of training data and compute resources like GPT-4,” the company said."
62,0.4359097182750702,0.12818056344985962,"Musk has previously expressed concerns about the speed of development of AI, and the technology’s potential to fundamentally change human society for the worse."
63,0.2442042678594589,0.5115914642810822,"xAI said it expects Grok to rapidly improve as X’s users feed it with more information, which may fuel unease among those critical of Musk’s handling of the platform since he bought the company last October."
64,0.4041496515274048,0.19170069694519043,"The world’s richest person has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said that, under his leadership, the company would be “very reluctant” to delete content and permanently ban some users."
65,0.527703583240509,0.055407166481018066,"British far-right figure Tommy Robinson, who has a history of posting Islamophobic content on X, thanked Musk Sunday for reinstating his account, five years after being banned."
66,0.7436277866363525,0.4872555732727051,"Elon Musk declared artificial intelligence “one of the most disruptive forces in history” in a sit down conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that dove into the dangers and opportunities of AI on Thursday, capping off the UK’s inaugural AI Safety Summit."
67,0.6335850954055786,0.2671701908111572,"The two men spoke in an interview-style chat from a stage at Lancaster House, a government venue in central London often used for diplomatic purposes, before the conversation was opened up to questions from journalists. The conversation was then posted for streaming on Musk’s personal account on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter that he owns."
