He is the tough drill officer who humiliates and bullies new recruits, bellowing at them to hit the floor and give him 25 press-ups. But it turns out that this Austrian drama directed by David Wagner (himself an army veteran) is inspired by true events. The real-life Eismayer was a gay man who lived a double life for many years, and then fell in love with a younger colleague. The film is a surprisingly gentle, touching story about acceptance, though it is less than sizzling as a romance."

He lives as a straight man, married with a young son, but sneaks off to grab quickies with men in the backs of cars. At work he is feared; “Eismayer is a total psychopath,” whispers one soldier. But then along comes recruit Mario (Luka Dimic), a gay soldier who refuses to be humiliated. There’s a terrific moment when Mario runs stark naked around the barracks, shouting: “Fairies never freeze, sergeant major sir!” Eismayer, who has lived his life in fear of exposure, cannot wrap his head around out and proud Mario."

Mario wants them to be a proper couple, but Eismayer says it is cloud-cuckoo-land talk: the idea of the two of them getting married at the barracks and living happily ever after. But – spoiler alert – that’s exactly what happens. The film ends with a lovely heartwarming photo of the real-life pair on their wedding day, in matching white uniforms and medals."

The landlord called the police, one of whom punched Andrew in the face.

But, if anything, the jokes that were written six years ago are just more relevant.” One character says that her vagina belongs to the government, a line that was written long before Roe v Wade was overturned."

143,0.627930223941803,0.25586044788360596,"The most insistent spectre in Torres’s novel is Jan Gay, AKA Helen Reitman (1902-1960), the pioneering queer sociologist (“specimen and expert both”). In the 1920s and 30s, Gay conducted hundreds of interviews in the hope of demystifying and normalising queer desire. But to publish her work she needed the imprimatur of a physician, some redoubtable white-coated gent. The result was the landmark report Sex Variants: A Study of Homosexual Patterns (1941), in which Gay’s work was hijacked and pathologised by a team of American doctors – testimonies twisted into diagnoses. But the report also preserved dozens of her interviews, a rare and precious record of queer life in the golden age of eugenics."

In a previous life the Palace may have been a hotel or “stately asylum”. Now it seems to function as a cut-price hospice, or perhaps something a little more purgatorial: the ultimate halfway house.
