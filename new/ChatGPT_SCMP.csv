26,0.7745948433876038,0.5491896867752075,MLLMs such as ChatGPT or Google’s Bard typically process image content into text in two steps: they first use a visual encoder to extract features from the image; and then feed these features into the model to generate a corresponding text description.
27,0.3955956101417541,0.2088087797164918,The research team outlined two types of adversarial attacks against MLLMs: image feature attack and text description attack.

29,0.3282552659511566,0.34348946809768677,"The former changes the features of a sample, affecting subsequent judgments. The latter attacks the entire process, resulting in generated descriptions that differ from the correct ones, thereby confusing the machine."
30,0.5112902522087097,0.022580504417419434,"The adversarial attacks made minute, almost imperceptible, changes to the original picture. To the human eye, the altered samples showed almost no difference to the original image."
31,0.3857371211051941,0.22852575778961182,"Bard – with its face detection and toxicity detection mechanisms – actively rejects images containing faces or violent, bloody, or pornographic content to protect privacy and prevent abuse."
32,0.5287673473358154,0.05753469467163086,"The overall decision-making process of MLLMs is a “black box”, with its architecture and parameters remaining unknown. However, the algorithms for face and toxicity detection are familiar to scientists with researchers launching attacks on these sub-models."
33,0.4951872229576111,0.009625554084777832,"The team applied similar mathematical manipulations and manually collected photos to attack Bard. According to their paper, 38 per cent of images bypassed the face detector, and 36 per cent evaded the toxicity detector."
34,0.7370967864990234,0.4741935729980469,"For instance, in a breach of its own privacy protections, Bard identified a Korean singer and provided detailed content descriptions for an image of a group of soldiers holding guns, which contained violent information."
35,0.8115038871765137,0.6230077743530273,The experiment emphasises the potential for malicious attackers to use Bard to generate inappropriate descriptions of harmful content.
36,0.8852145075798035,0.7704290151596069,"With a similar attack method, a giant panda’s face is misclassified as a woman’s face by Bard, a group of antelopes is misclassified as hands by GPT-4V and a bald eagle is misclassified as a cat and a dog in Bing Chat, a cup of coffee is misclassified as a watch in Baidu’s Ernie Bot, whose description was in Chinese."
37,0.9063878655433656,0.8127757310867312,These findings suggest that most MLLMs have vulnerabilities in their image content recognition.
38,0.5874156355857849,0.17483127117156982,"From the code the Chinese team provided with the paper, 200 generated adversarial examples can mislead AI models to output the wrong image descriptions, with a 22 per cent success rate against Bard, 26 per cent success against Bing Chat and an 86 per cent attack success rate against Ernie Bot."

42,0.4701657593250274,0.05966848134994518,"However, there is an imbalance between research into attacking and defending AI models. An anonymous researcher said most annual publications on adversarial models focused on attacks, with only a few investigating defence."
43,0.4196187257766723,0.16076254844665538,"“This is because a single defence strategy may only be effective against one type of attack, and it is far more difficult to defend against all potential attacks than to target a fixed objective,” he said."

While students are grappling with new knowledge, they are also dealing with new software pervasive in academic life – generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While each university and school has its own approach to the use of GenAI, in general, there are three areas in which students need to be cautious while using it in assessments."
115,0.8405231833457947,0.6810463666915894,"First and foremost, GenAI may provide fake or inaccurate information.

117,0.8209313154220581,0.6418626308441162,"Second, GenAI can lead to plagiarism. The information it provides could be a direct copy without proper acknowledgement of the original source."

119,0.3364991843700409,0.3270016312599182,"Finally, GenAI cannot provide in-depth critical insight. GenAI can be applied to homework that involves summarising. But students may still need to write argumentative essays themselves."
