Miaoya, or "fabulous duck", is not a dish you can eat, but its developers are hoping it will prove to be a recipe for profits all the same.
The AI-powered app, developed by Weixu Network Technology, has gone viral in China by making it cheap and easy for users to generate stylized, AI-embellished photos of themselves dressed in office suits, high school uniforms, or ancient costumes.
Users need to first upload more than 20 photos to the app, and then queue virtually for a few hours to get the results. But the quality of the portraits is worth the time and effort, especially for the price: a onetime downloading fee of 9.9 yuan ($1.36), whereas a comparable real-life studio photo shoot could cost upward of 500 yuan.
Chinese consumers may not have easy access to leading platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, but that hasn't stopped them from embracing AI technology.
Firms including app makers, productivity software developers and self-driving car companies have all joined the fray by launching AI-powered products or services. But a fundamental question facing the AI sector in China and elsewhere is how these novel and still imperfect technologies can be monetized. It's also a question weighing on the minds of Chinese investors, as the recent AI frenzy in the local stock market cools.
China faces several challenges in the global AI race. Not least is the United States' ban on exports of the leading-edge semiconductors needed to power the fastest and most advanced AI solutions. The resulting supply chain bottlenecks will be a fixed hurdle for developing better foundation models (large language models like OpenAI's GPT). On the other hand, Chinese firms arguably have an edge over their foreign competitors when it comes to the massive amount of data they are able to access with comparative ease from consumers and other sources in China — although this could change if data privacy rules are tightened or consumers grow less willing to hand over their personal data.
To see big data being put to work in China, consider autonomous vehicles. In the Beijing suburb of Yizhuang, a sprawling 60-square-kilometer area south of the city center, a fleet of taxis operated by Baidu Inc picks up and drops off passengers just like a normal taxi ride. The main difference is that the human in the driver's seat is not a driver, but a "safety supervisor" who only touches the steering wheel when absolutely necessary. According to Baidu, its robo-taxi service has offered more than 3.3 million rides in China. And now the service is in the midst of a technological upgrade: the tech giant has recently started deploying fully autonomous taxis — with no human staff inside — in four cities including Beijing.
New gold rush?
Dazzling applications aside, AI developers need to eventually turn a profit to grow a sustainable industry. While there are many differences between the global AI rush in 2023 and the California gold rush in 1848, one thing is similar: selling "picks and shovels" is the surest way to make money. Hardware is the prerequisite to building and deploying AI applications.
For now, hardware makers offer the most visibility in how to turn AI-related demand into profits. Although Chinese mainland's graphic processing units can't compete with those from overseas suppliers, manufacturers of servers and printed circuit boards may see increasing demand driven by the shift to AI solutions. At the infrastructure layer, the growing need for training and running LLMs will benefit hyper-scalers, or firms that provide large-scale data centers or cloud servers where these exponentially growing calculations will take place.
Governments will also have a big say in how quickly AI rolls out. So far, Chinese policymakers have generally been supportive of the AI boom boosting economic productivity. The government recently introduced regulations on generative AI, becoming one of the first countries in the world to regulate the nascent technology. The rules are in general less strict than some expected. But there are still questions over how the authorities will regulate the sector as it matures and develops.
Finally, compared with hardware, the monetization path for software companies is less clear. In market segments facing intense competition, like consumer apps, copycats will put downward pressure on profit margins for innovators who shoulder huge computing costs. Chinese consumers may be less willing to pay for software solutions than their counterparts in the US or other markets. Despite these risks, we believe China's AI consumer apps may be better placed to monetize than enterprise apps, given the size and ease of access to the consumer base, and how accustomed people are to adopting new digital solutions. There may, of course, be unique setbacks along AI's development path in China, but these are a feature, not a bug, of innovation.
The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.

China's consumer electronics market is expected to gain growth momentum, with total revenue reaching 2.3 trillion yuan ($315.7 billion) in 2024, an increase of 5 percent year-on-year, fueled by the rapid development of devices utilizing the internet of things and artificial intelligence technology, according to a white paper released by market research company GfK.
China's economy is on an upward trajectory, while the consumer electronics sector has reached an "inflection point" and is set to rebound, the white paper said, adding that increasing demand from consumers and technological innovation will result in the continued growth of China's consumer electronics industry.
The meteoric rise of ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by US-based AI company OpenAI, has brought significant impacts to many industries. Therefore, AI-enabled consumer electronics devices, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, are predicted to experience explosive growth, it noted.
Frankie Lee, vice-president of marketing at Nielsen IQ GfK Asia-Pacific, told China Daily that the IoT market is recovering quickly, with wireless earbuds and smartwatches starting to recover earlier than smartphones.
"With the launch of AI large language models, it is clear that the scenarios of AI applications have changed from personal computers to other IoT devices, including smartphones, smart speakers and smart home devices," Lee said, adding that the development in IoT devices and AI will further accelerate the upgrading of the whole consumer electronics industry.
The domestic consumer electronics market is projected to see a steady recovery in 2023, with total retail sales increasing by about 11 percent year-on-year in the second half, with the growth rate of this segment likely to reach 4 percent this year, according to the white paper.
Lee said Chinese consumer confidence had returned to its highest level since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the economic situation of Chinese households had generally improved in the past six months, according to GfK's survey of consumer confidence in China in May.
"We noticed that consumers are more likely to buy products with better durability than they did before the pandemic. Comparatively speaking, Chinese consumers are more inclined to buy consumer electronics products than the average global consumers," Lee said.
Against the backdrop of sluggish global economic recovery, consumers look for innovation to free up time and are pursuing a flexible lifestyle. According to GfK consumer research data, 41 percent of consumers worldwide are willing to pay more for products that make life easier.
In addition, GfK predicts that China will transform from a follower to a leader, eventually taking the leading position in technological innovation in the next decade. Connected devices powered by 5G and smart applications enabled by AI and artificial intelligence of things have become the most powerful drivers for innovation and growth in the consumer electronics industry.
"Chinese brands have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in new categories of hardware products, such as AIoT, robot vacuum cleaners and AR and VR," GfK added.
Chinese consumer electronics manufacturers have accelerated efforts to integrate AI chatbots into their products and services in hopes of providing a better human-machine interaction experience.
For instance, Midea Group, based in Foshan, Guangdong province, is among the first batch of partners for Ernie Bot, a ChatGPT-like AI chatbot launched by Chinese tech heavyweight Baidu Inc in March. Midea will bolster the upgrade of human-machine conversation abilities in the smart home sector by using cutting-edge generative AI technology.
The emergence of new AI technologies will better facilitate the conversational interaction between human beings and electronic devices, and speed up the digital and intelligent transformation of China's consumer electronics industry, said Liu Fei, research director of the consumer electronics department at Beijing-based market consultancy All View Cloud.
Liu said the iteration and upgrade of product functions and technologies will stimulate consumers' purchasing appetites and create new revenue growth drivers for companies. The move also demonstrates the continuous exploration of large language models in the scenario of intelligent content production, he added.
China will step up efforts to develop future industries and cutting-edge technologies, in order to offer greater vitality for global industrial development and economic growth, government officials, company executives and industry experts said on Sunday.
They made the remarks at a session of the Hongqiao International Economic Forum during the sixth China International Import Expo in Shanghai. The session focused on future industries, which mainly refer to emerging sectors including artificial intelligence, humanoid robots and the industrial internet.
Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, said China will promote the research and development of cutting-edge technologies to create an innovation collaboration circle globally.
He emphasized that more efforts will also be made to develop future industries to promote the upgrading of traditional industries, especially the integration of AI and metaverse with manufacturing.
"China welcomes global partners, including international R&D institutions, to jointly promote new technological breakthroughs and create a global source of innovation," Xin said.
"We will also give full play to the role of bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms to deepen exchanges and mutual trust in policy standards and rules, and strengthen global digital governance," he added.
For more global cooperation on technology and related policies, Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said at the session that an integrated technology ecosystem could create value on a global scale.
"Innovative capabilities and large domestic markets of both the US and China offer great potential for bilateral cooperation, especially in science, public health and the green technology sector," he said.
Allen noted that the United States is home to many of the companies that lead global innovation and technology development, while China has seen dramatic growth since its reform and opening-up and enabled world-class innovations.
"Collaboration at the company level could provide the types of new technology that we need to address daunting challenges of climate change, public health and feeding a hungry world," he said.
According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China has made breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies like AI large language models and brain-computer interfaces. The country also aims to boost its aggregate computing power, a key technology driving AI application, by more than 30 percent by 2025.
Buoyed by such momentum, Chinese companies are also stepping up efforts in developing cutting-edge technologies and future industries and strive to promote more industrial applications of such technologies.
As ChatGPT from Open AI, a US company, takes the tech world by storm, Jia Jiaya, founder of smart manufacturing company SmartMore, said the Chinese company didn't follow the trend blindly.
"We found that GPT-4 is less efficient in the industrial sector and it is where we found opportunities," Jia said. His company developed industry GPT, one of the first in the industrial sector, which aims to leverage the large language model to drive the efficiency of industrial sectors.
"No large language model in the world can serve high-end manufacturing currently, and we hope that Chinese companies can develop such large language models to enable frontier technologies to empower industries," he added.
Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology, said in an interview with China Central Television on Saturday that technologies such as AI can empower China's new industrialization push, and their applications in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare and the metaverse will be an important symbol of a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation.
The country will step up research on future-oriented technologies such as AI and introduce industrial policies to encourage local governments to take the lead in piloting its applications, he said.
Jin said that in the first three quarters of this year, China's industrial economy stabilized and rebounded, showing a positive trend of recovery, and more efforts will be made to unleash the vitality of enterprises for more positive momentum of economic recovery.
If foreigners learning Chinese think the modern language is difficult to grasp, they should be glad they don't have to learn classical Chinese. Ancient texts are far more challenging, and not easy for even native Chinese speakers to decipher.
Thankfully, a team of researchers from the South China University of Technology has made such work easier. The team has developed a large, artificial intelligence-powered language machine that automatically translates ancient Chinese texts into modern language.
The team won first prize in the international ancient Chinese machine translation contest during the Machine Translation Summit 2023 held in the Macao Special Administrative Region in September. The system could help enhance people's understanding of Chinese history and promote traditional Chinese culture, said Jin Lianwen, the professor who led the research team in their work at the university's deep learning and vision computing lab.
It could also help with data mining and analysis, and intelligent development and application related to ancient texts and relics, he said.
The massive system requires powerful computing capacity, which was a huge hurdle the team had to overcome during its research, Jin said, adding that the team received multiple graphic processing unit servers from a cooperating company.
The machine translation is meant to provide classical Chinese enthusiasts with a convenient way to gain a general understanding of ancient texts, with Jin saying that authoritative publications should be the go-to sources for precise translations.
The major challenge in robotic ancient language translation was the lack of high-quality ancient language data, Li Bin, an associate professor in the linguistic technology department at Nanjing Normal University, told a seminar at the summit.
At present, such translation relies heavily on the professional knowledge of classical language experts.
Jin's team has also developed a system that recognizes and analyzes ancient Chinese text on pictures. The system automatically locates, extracts and arranges related texts in order. The texts can then be punctuated and translated into modern Chinese using the aforementioned language system.
The algorithm for the system has been optimized to address challenges such as analyzing text on wrinkled or creased photos or those with low resolution.
In cooperation with Shanghai University and the Intsig Information Co, Jin's team has also created a system for analyzing and recognizing texts written in the language of China's Yi ethnic group.
Classical text translation technology, when combined with text recognition technology, can facilitate ancient text digitalization and understanding.
When joined by powerful AI technology such as ChatGPT, it can become an interactive system for understanding ancient texts.
The team will continue its research on ancient text understanding and protection, Jin said, adding that sufficient computing capacity will be necessary for further research.
The ongoing technology advance, driven by artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), a key technology behind ChatGPT, is expected to bring profound impact to the education industry, according to a senior company executive.
Li Yi, founder of Yuanbiancheng, an AI education startup, said that AI education is not only about studying AI but also about adapting to the AI era.
"AI education is a systematic project that involves enlightenment cognition, thinking training, hands-on practice and fusion innovations," Li said.
"Thus, it is unrealistic for children to learn abstruse AI knowledge at primary school, but it is necessary to prepare them for the corresponding abilities and understanding of AI," he added.
To help children learn about the latest progress of AI technology, Yuanbiancheng introduced the development of AIGC technology into curriculums, which according to him, serves as children's first AI lesson.
On the other hand, AIGC technology has been applied into the company's service platform, Li noted.
"For instance, if a child writes a piece of code and encounters a bug, he or she used to rely on the human teacher to guide him or her. Now, AIGC technology can automatically find the error and offer an adjustment plan," he explained.
A platform powered by artificial intelligence and launched by a 13-year-old quickly went viral among middle school students after making its debut in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, last month.
AI-Button, the platform founded by middle school student Qiu Yumo, who entered the eighth grade this year, enables students to customize learning guidance by simply uploading material.
With ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by United States company OpenAI, taking the world of technology by storm, Qiu used the large language model — a key ChatGPT technology — for the first time to develop her learning platform.
The AI revolution, which many technology industry experts believe is underpinned by ChatGPT, is driving a new form of entrepreneurship, described as "smaller, faster, cheaper and weirder" by Nathan Baschez, co-founder of US daily newsletter startup Every Inc.
Along with Qiu, young people from China, especially those born in the 1990s and 2000s, are increasingly plunging into AI entrepreneurship.
Qiu, who was born in 2010, started programming when she was 6. She wrote a computer game one year later, which triggered her interest in developing complicated software.
With the idea of making a small learning tool for herself, she used the large language model and other emerging AI technologies to create AI-Button earlier this year.
"It was only after ChatGPT began to take off that I sensed the opportunities brought by the new AI generation, and I realized that such technologies can change the world," Qiu said.
ChatGPT is driving the AI revolution, which a Goldman Sachs research report said has the potential to bring sweeping changes to the global economy, and could produce a rise of 7 percent, or almost $7 trillion, in global GDP, over the next decade.
Buoyed by this trend, a new form of AI startups has emerged. In China, unlike previous such startups that needed star founders, huge amounts of financing, and dozens of employees, the advent of ChatGPT offers a new chance for all entrepreneurs.
For example, Qiu formed a team of students from her middle school and those in the neighborhood to help her. Some team members were in charge of testing and optimization, some were responsible for promotion work, while others helped with external liaison and cooperation.
Inspired by online public welfare projects launched by tech giant Tencent Holdings, Qiu and her partners encouraged students to use AI-Button. Students can initiate and take part in public welfare projects and receive benefits from them, which can be used for learning on the platform.
All the team members attended weekly meetings to ensure progress was made. After several months of development and product optimization, AI-Button finally became a mature project and registration began for users.
"For the first time, I realized that no one can do everything, but everyone can do something," Qiu said.
Baschez, from Every Inc, said in a note that AI startups in this new age begin small. "They use open source and cloud computing to get off the ground quickly and perform recurring tasks. Thanks to AI, they will stay smaller for much longer, and the most successful will achieve staggering results with only a handful of employees," he said.
His comments are supported by the example of Midjourney, a system that uses AI to generate pictures from text descriptions. The Midjouney team at his beginning comprised only 11 full-time employees, with four of them students who had yet to graduate and were not studying at leading universities.
Baschez said, "More important, this new type of organization can try out fresh ideas.
"The entry barrier is already lower than ever, but now that AI is good enough to design interfaces, write code, and execute marketing campaigns, we're going to see a whole new set of experiments come online."
In China, Miaoya Camera, an AI-powered digital product that generates self-portraits online, launched as a mini program on WeChat in July, just five months after the launch team of six Chinese software professionals, who were born in the late 1980s and early 1990s, conceptualized and developed the product.
To obtain an AI portrait by using Miaoya Camera, users pay 9.90 yuan ($1.40) and upload at least 20 recent portraits to get a digital clone. They then turn the clone into different types of portraits, such as ID photos, business photos, or those in an ancient Chinese style.
Users can train the AI to make the portraits more lifelike. Industry experts said this is the logical outcome of AI, where a generative model takes what it learns from examples to create something new.
During peak times, more than 6,000 people wait online to use the product. Some even wait for more than 15 hours to obtain a digital clone. Within a month of its launch, Miaoya Camera was viewed by market observers as a potential disruptor of the AIGC, or artificial intelligence-generated content, niche market arising from the arrival of ChatGPT.
AIGC uses AI algorithms and technologies to generate high-quality content, including articles, blog posts, product descriptions and social media updates.
Zhang Yueguang, leader of a group of students who graduated from Tsinghua University in 2012, said the portrait generator's market performance is way beyond his expectations. He attributes part of this success to the new wave of AIGC, with a large number of consumers looking forward to applications that use ChatGPT-related technologies.
"I think the business logic of AIGC and the internet is fundamentally different. Business on the internet is essentially about information flow, channels and platforms. But the essence of the AI era can be compared with building a factory. Technologies that point to market demand are more easily accepted by customers," he said.
Wang Peng, a senior researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that when ChatGPT delivers further technological advances, more Chinese consumers will be willing to embrace such technologies, resulting in further success for applications such as Miaoya Camera.
A poll carried out by the lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu found that 72 percent of young users preferred a profile photo created by Miaoya Camera to one taken by Tianzhenlan, a major professional portrait photography chain.
Wang said: "More important, AIGC is lowering the threshold for entrepreneurship. The US may have taken the lead in the AIGC race with ChatGPT, but China now stands on the same starting line with the US."
He added that this also means that Chinese AI entrepreneurs are catching up fast with their US counterparts in the new AIGC era.
Zhao Zhiyun, head of the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Technology, said the US and China have led global development of large-scale AI models, the key technology behind ChatGPT, contributing to 80 percent of them across the world.
"Development of China's large AI models is booming, with breakthroughs being made in several technical areas at the same time," Zhao said.
Zhou Yu, chairman of Beijing Fanyu Technology Co, a leading natural language processing products and services startup, said that as the stakes are high, Chinese and US startups appear to be taking different approaches to developing large language models that drive generative AI.
"Founders of US startups put more emphasis on the research and development of underlying technology and groundbreaking innovations. The US is a world leader in terms of hardware and deep learning frameworks," Zhou said.
"Chinese AI startups focus more on applications, and those launching these startups are better at adapting technology to various industries, and commercializing different applications. They are also more flexible in creating personalized products and innovations, especially in niche sectors, thus giving the younger generation more opportunities."
A report by the China Foundation for Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment said those in the 19-23 age bracket in China comprise the main group of young entrepreneurs. Nearly 70 percent of them started a company with less than 100,000 yuan ($13,680). More than half have experienced fluctuations in profits and losses, but 70 percent of them began making a profit within three years.
Another report, from the Chinese Academy of Labour and Social Security, said rapid development of the digital economy has attracted a large number of young people, especially those under the age of 35, to start a business.
Such entrepreneurship is mainly due to digital technologies that lower the entry barrier to starting a business and offering good employment conditions. As a result, rapid development of the digital economy has helped drive a new form of employment for young people, the report said.
For example, those younger than 35 account for more than 73 percent of mini-program developers on major social media platforms, the report said, adding that the younger generation has become an indispensable force for the development of the digital economy in China.
Chen Yuheng, a cofounder of SenseTime, a Hong Kong-listed Chinese AI pioneer, was born in the 1990s. He has witnessed the development of the internet and AI in China, and the way in which ChatGPT has triggered the nation's AI boom.
Shortly after graduating from Tsinghua University in 2013, he and several friends founded SenseTime. Chen rose from being No 3 employee at the startup to cofounder of the first listed AI business on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
SenseTime started by focusing on computer vision, before expanding into more business areas, including autonomous driving technologies.
The company is flexing its technological muscle amid the AI boom triggered by ChatGPT.In August, SenseChat, its large language model, officially opened to the public for registration after being approved by the authorities.
SenseTime devoted numerous resources to researching and developing InternLM, a pre-trained large language AI model developed in collaboration with several leading domestic research institutions, including the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
Chen said, "I am fortunate to grow with the development of AI, but I now also need to keep up with these changing times."
The joint venture between Chinese carmaker Geely Holding Group and tech heavyweight Baidu Inc has launched its first artificial intelligence-powered electric vehicle called Ji Yue 01.
Priced from 249,900 yuan ($34,151.8), the sports utility vehicle features level 4 (L4) autonomous driving technology, a voice-activated control system and advanced intelligent cabins. L4 autonomy means the car can drive itself in most conditions without a human driver.
It integrates Ernie Bot, Baidu's ChatGPT-like large language model, to offer AI interactive experience for intelligent vehicles. The car can go as far as 720 kilometers on a single charge.
Baidu and Geely set up a joint venture called Jidu Auto in March 2021 to focus on developing intelligent electric vehicles. The two companies announced a significant advancement in their strategic partnership in August, marking a new milestone with the introduction of Ji Yue, a premium intelligent technology brand.
Sales of NEVs in the country expanded 27.7 percent year-on-year to 904,000 units in September, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed. In the first nine months of the year, NEV sales increased 37.5 percent from a year ago to 6.28 million units, the CAAM said.
Chinese high-tech company iFlytek unveiled the latest version of its large language model (LLM) SparkDesk on Tuesday, with its overall capability seeing substantial improvement.
"With continuous improvements in the past months, Spark-Desk V3.0 displays an overall capability that is stronger than ChatGPT, according to a test and evaluation report by the Guoyan Institute of Economic Research," said Liu Qingfeng, founder and chairman of iFlytek.
The institute is affiliated with the Development Research Center of the State Council, China's Cabinet.
Liu made the remarks during the opening ceremony of the iFlytek Global Developer Festival 2023 in Hefei, capital of East China's Anhui province, where the company is headquartered.
He said the model's core capability is evaluated in seven dimensions — text generation, language understanding, Q&A knowledge, logical reasoning, mathematic ability, coding ability and multimodal ability.
As AI technology depends greatly on computing power, the company has collaborated closely with Huawei in the past months.
During Tuesday's event, which was co-presented by Huawei's rotating Chairman Xu Zhijun, the two firms launched a jointly developed computing power platform, Feixing No 1, to support more LLMs.
The new platform is based on Huawei's Ascend Computing, an all-scenario AI infrastructure, according to the companies.
SparkDesk has been widely touted as a Chinese-language alternative to ChatGPT after it became accessible to designated users for testing in April and was officially launched in May.
The model was officially available to the public in early September after the service was approved by relevant central authorities.
It ranked first among the domestic mainstream models evaluation list released by Xinhua News Agency's Chinese Enterprise Development Research Center.
As part of the developers' event, more than 34,000 teams from 278 cities from nine countries participated in the 2023 iFlytek AI Developer Competition.
Senior local officials participating in the event said iFlytek has been a great long-term contributor to the local economy.
Since 2012, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Anhui provincial government have been developing China Speech Valley, a high-tech industrial park in Hefei, into a major hub for the AI industry.
As the largest company in the park, iFlytek made its technology accessible to developers from around the world through its open online platforms since 2010.
"Since May 6, when SparkDesk was launched, the number of global developer teams using our open platforms has increased by 1.43 million," said Liu.
"By the end of 2022, a total of 2,005 firms had been founded in the valley, with their main business operation revenue totaling 205 billion yuan ($28.05 billion)," said Pan Feng, chief economist of the Anhui provincial government's industry and information technology department during a news conference last week.
In the second installment of her K-pop series, Faye Bradley discovers how Hong Kong's tech wizards and metaverse architects are changing the ways in which K-pop is consumed.
Earlier this year, a four-member all-girl K-pop group claimed the spotlight. Launched by Metaverse Entertainment in January, Mave had racked up over 20 million views for its hit single Pandora in less than a month. At first glance, Mave comes across as a regular quartet of teenage performers. Only that its members are not human. The figures were created using machine learning, deep fake and real-time 3D rendering technologies. Though they look almost real, a closer scrutiny reveals that the even skin tones and flawless figures of these virtual performers are too good to be true.
Mave is just one among a number of virtual K-pop groups to have emerged during the most restrictive phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eternity and its hit single I'm Real debuted in 2021. Launched in 2020, Aespa is a hybrid of the real and virtual. The band's human artists sometimes share the stage with their digital counterparts, hologrammed into the concert arena. Kakao Entertainment launched Feverse this past May. Thirty human contestants chosen from existing K-pop bands competed in a survival virtual reality show under the guise of their digital avatars for a place in the five-member virtual girl band.
South Korean virtual boy band Plave attracted over 250,000 YouTube subscribers soon after its debut in 2023. Behind each of the band's five animated 3D figures is a human artist, performing the vocals and dance movements, generated with the help of real-time motion capture technology.
On Tuesday, Chinese tech heavyweight Baidu Inc unveiled the latest version of its large language model, Ernie 4.0, saying its capabilities are on par with those of OpenAI's most advanced GPT-4 model.
The newest version boasts enhanced core capacities in understanding, generation, reasoning and memory compared with previous models, said Robin Li, co-founder and CEO of Baidu, at Baidu World 2023, the company's annual flagship event held in Beijing.
Li showcased the four main capabilities of Ernie 4.0 at the launch event. He displayed the model's generative skills to produce advertising posters and videos, tested its reasoning abilities with math problems, and evaluated its memory skills by letting it write a martial arts novel in real-time.
Li said these capabilities are the foundation on which all AI-native applications thrive. Baidu has also rolled out China's first generative business intelligence product, Baidu GBI, which simplifies data queries and analysis through natural language interactions.
Baidu introduced Ernie Bot, its LLM and ChatGPT-like product, in March. In August, the company was among a number of firms to receive government approval to open its LLM to the public.
LLMs refer to computer algorithms that are trained with huge amounts of data and are capable of generating content such as images, text, audio and video. They are the key technology underpinning ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by US-based AI research company OpenAI.
